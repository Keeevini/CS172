* When someone calls the whistleblower a liar/traitor, make a pirate arrrgh and sip

* When anyone uses a whataboutism, stand up, spin around 360, and consume

* If anyone mentions ""fake news"", smack your forehead and say ""duh"", then imbibe

* If anyone mentions Giuliani, take the little green man off your glass, then take a glug

* Put your thumb on the table anytime someone says ""witch hunt:, and the last person to do so takes one

They have been after Trump for so long and so many reasons that there is no doubt in my mind that this hearing will definitely last until the end of his presidency.

If he is re-elected, it will last until the end of that presidency.

But hey, since the Dems are in control, and so focused on the Trump impeachment circlejerk, at least I wont have to worry about the government actually doing something. I hate change.

Maybe the drinking game could be sit down and watch the actual hearing with a six pack. Every day. Surefire way to make sure nothing happens in the rest of the country too!

Plus, it would be a long term excuse for high functioning alcoholics to drink for years at a time. It is win-win. All of it would make America more like soviet Russia, which is the end goal right? Isn't that the communism what Bernie and Warren are selling? State gets all and redistributes to the people?

I dont get why Russian collusion was even a thing. All the folks who were pushing it were or are trying to make America more like Russia. You realize this is going to ruin that comedian smirnoff's career right? It's gonna be ""In soviet America, road forks you!""

But I digress, whatever three ring circus makes the people happy is my motto. Heck this never ending impeachment saga has made a lot of people happy. I bet most of the world is busy laughing at us.

Edit: holy shit, you all have been the nicest, most supportive people! I appreciate every single one of you for that. I'll give a general answer to a lot of questions then respond to everybody individually. Yes, I'm doing a lot better. I do still drink, but a lot less than I used to. Now, a 12 pack would take me a couple of days. Used to be a couple of hours. 

Once again, please be safe with alcohol. Just because it's legal doesn't always make it a good decision.

DOUBLE EDIT!!! If someone you care about is an alcoholic, try to reach out to them. Sometimes we don't realize how bad we are until the people we love most desert us, which usually leads to an even worse cycle of abuse. If you are an alcoholic and want to stop or at least slow down, my best advice is to find someone else who is and also wants to improve themselves. Actively listen to them when they share their feelings, and expect the same from them when you share yours. It's not easy, but who ever said that improving your life was?

AA can work for some, group settings can work for some, other options can work for some. Find what works best for you. Will you fail? Most likely. I did several times. I'm still not fully sober. But that first step and COMMITMENT to it is the most important part.

980,f6xv3xc,t1_f6xtemw,"Donald Trump withheld military aid that had been guaranteed to Ukraine, one of our international allies. He told the Ukrainian President the aid would come if he agreed to publically announce that he was investigating the Bidens and the previous Ukranian administration's ""attempts to collude with the DNC and attack the 2016 election."" That last bit is a conspiracy theory floated by Paul Manafort back in 2016 before the election that for some reason the DNC colluded with Ukraine to hack and release their own emails. Because reasons.

A foreign intelligence official in the white house heard about all this and was concerned and filed a whistleblower complaint. That complaint got held up and Congress was not notified, which legally they should have been. The whistleblower then reached out to Congress to ask ""Hey, I filed a complaint and it should have been given to you by now. Do you know about this?"" Congress did not know, as the complaint was being held up by White House officials installed by Trump. Once news gets out that there is a complaint, Trump tries to get ahead of the story and released a memorandum of the phone call to prove ""there is no quid pro quo, there is nothing wrong with this phone call."" 

When you read that memo, it becomes clear there in fact is something wrong. By all appearances, the President of the United States was extorting a foreign government for personal gain and political advantage. He was trying to get Ukraine to manufacture a scandal that would damage one of his leading political rivals. That prompted the Democrats in the house to investigate just how deep this abuse of power goes pursuant to impeachment.

Trump later went on live television and told China to investigate the Bidens. The President told a foreign adversary they should investigate an American Citizen, which would happen to benefit him politically. Seems like there is a pattern at this point.",t3_dtmyxw

Impeachment hasn't been supported by a large number of Democrats until now. Even after evidence of obstruction of justice the majority still didn't push for impeachment. 

What's happening now is a big deal, and they're supporting it because Trump is indefensible at this point. His own people have admitted it was a quid pro quo to get an investigation into Trump's political appointment.

[Here's an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/06/how-rising-inequality-hurts-everyone-even-the-rich/) highlighting many of the problems with wealth disparity, how it is bad for the economy. This uses economist papers to make its point. So it is sourced by people who understand this way better than you or I.

2. There are numerous issues with the way poverty is measured in the United States. For example, the poverty line was supposed to be 50% of the median family income, that is simply [not the case](https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/federal-poverty-line1.jpg). Our definition of poverty has not changed with either inflation or as economic standards have changed. In fact, Americans estimate that 40% of the population lives in poverty--which is not at all reflected in our data about what poverty is at in this country. Here's an article that talks about some of the measures by which we can say [poverty is the worst it has ever been](https://thinkprogress.org/why-poverty-is-a-much-bigger-problem-than-the-government-thinks-c07ea20f0310/). 

3. [40% of Americans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nearly-40-of-americans-cant-cover-a-surprise-400-expense/) can't cover a surprise $400 expense. In a country as prosperous as ours, this is an absolute travesty. Some studies find that 58% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts. Also why are you cherry-picking a recession and comparing it to today. This is a direct quote: 
> There was a time in the 1970s when the savings rate in the United States was in the double digits. But the most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics put it at 6 percent, the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. The drop is part of a 60-year downward trend in the personal savings rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
> 

4. The vast majority of high paying jobs, or even average paying ones require a college degree of some kind. This will get even worse in the coming years as automation kills off minimum wage jobs. College is a necessity in this economy and our system does not work at all. 

5. There are studies that find that home ownership has a profound effect on health, specifically mental health and cardiovascular health. In a growing economy, like right after WW2, people could afford houses. It's just one of many signs that the economy is doing well. 

6. You're only looking at it from a purely numbers perspective. This country has more than enough space for a population double our current size, and resources too. The major issue of a low birth rate (lowest since 1986) is that it greatly disbalances the work force and we aren't having enough babies to sustain our population as it ages. But ignoring all that, here's a quote from an article that sums up the problem nicely, in regards to economy (again referring to economists and experts in the field):
> The record-low fertility rate likely isn’t a sign that the United States’ younger generations are rejecting having children. Rather, the way Benjamin Guzzo and many other observers see it, it’s a sign that the country isn’t providing the support Americans feel they need in order to have children.

7. That's just a lie peddled by Trump and may even stem from a complete misunderstanding of what national debt even is. This claim has been [debunked](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/did-trade-deficit-cause-20-trillion-debt#:~:targetText=President%20Trump%20appears%20to%20be,national%20debt%2C%20currently%20%2419.8%20trillion.) and they have nothing to do with each other. It just sounds great for supporters to be able to say it is all Obama's fault. 

8. I own two homes, I didn't miss out on anything. One of the homes has gained nearly 800% in appreciation. What does any of this have to do with the fact that we are in an almost identical situation to 2007? You're not responding to the facts, you're just trying to deflect here. 

9. I'm saying that this isn't a great thing by Trump or any other president. Unemployment has been falling for the last century, no one president is responsible. Stocks have been rising for the last century, no one president is responsible. 

10. No, it's not the reality. This is the lie that was peddled by Reagan and has become the mantra of the GOP. Here's a quote from the IMF:
> The International Monetary Fund also rejects the trickle-down theory.﻿﻿ In its report authored by five economists, it argues that “…if the income share of the top 20% increases, then GDP growth actually declined over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down.” The IMF’s fight against income inequality revolves around the fact that expenditures of middle- to low-income sectors are the drivers of the economy. Even a mere 1% increase in wealth for 20% of low-income earners yields a 0.38% growth in gross domestic product. On the other hand, increasing the income of the top 20% high-income earners results in a negative 0.08% growth in GDP.",t3_dtmyxw

I had my appendix out this summer, and some weeks later I had an MR scan of my entire intestinal system because they had spotted some inflammation in other places when they operated on me. Two weeks after that I get called in to the hospital to meet the doctor. 

I'm met by the chief nurse (I'm not entirely sure of the corresponding titles in English here) who takes me to an examination room that is, I kid you not, barely one step below an operating theatre. The the chief surgeon of the hospital comes in, and they sit me down. They're both looking at me with these professionally kind and compassionate faces and ask me several questions about how I've been since the surgery, have I had any problems afterwards, and so on. Then eventually the following exchange takes place:

Chief surgeon: ""We've looked at your MR scans and... they're perfectly fine. There's absolutely nothing wrong with you and you won't ever have to come back.""

I didn’t register how somber they were at first, so I was pleasantly surprised by their visit, albeit embarrassed because I was still in my pajamas. And then they told me my dad had died (I remember exactly how it went. “Your dad... had an accident.” “Oh my God, is he okay?” “He... He’s gone. I’m so sorry, Andrea. Your grandma sent us to bring you home.” And then I went back up the stairs, just repeating “Oh my God” over and over and tossing random clothes into a bag and hoping it would be enough because I could barely think.) 

My mom and grandma, who found him that morning, didn’t call me because they were afraid that I’d try to drive home but be too distraught to be safe in the snowy weather. But they’d called my roommates to tell them what happened and to make sure I didn’t leave and not to tell me yet. I didn’t have classes, so no big, but one of them had to go outside because she was so upset, and the other just tried to awkwardly talk to me knowing that my dad had died and that I was totally oblivious to it. My sister called, but when I picked up, my voice sounded too cheerful, so she knew I didn’t know yet, and she said she had to leave for work (she’s a couple time zones behind us) but would call me later. I actually called my dad’s cell to check if he knew what was going on with her, and assumed he was already at lunch when he didn’t pick up. In hindsight... I don’t think there were enough clues to anticipate something tragic had happened, but maybe I should have. I wonder what my mom or grandma would have said if I’d called the house to check if anything had happened with my sister. Or if they just wouldn’t have picked up.

I’m sorry for tl;dr’ing here. It’s only been about seven months, and I don’t know when I’m supposed to stop feeling like the event sort of owns my life and colors my responses to a lot of questions (if you check through my
comment history, I feel like I talk about my dad a lot) or even just how to process it or sometimes how to stop talking about it when I start.

Day 2: They woke me up even earlier. Unlike Day 1, we weren’t expecting them to be there in the morning, just later in the afternoon to drive me home. I was in my room sleeping and my Mom knocks on the door.

Managers had their fun and said a box had busted open during the week and they couldn't resist. That kid looked like he was about to quit on the spot before taking that test though hahah

I got pulled into a meeting with HR and there were two other employees with me. I didn't think anything of it because one of the guys with me was like...the most loved associate on our team. He managed a national account and everyone that called in always asked for him. 

So we're chilling and waiting for things to kick off when I realized what was up. I caught a glimpse of my manager out in the hall. She was standing a ways down talking to HR and she had red eyes and looked like she was crying. HR rolled through and laid the three of us off. I was stunned at first cause it came out of nowhere and it was weird to know my ball-buster of a manager actually gave a shit. So I grabbed my stuff and left thinking that it had come from higher up and there was nothing we could do.

Turns out they laid off the three of us cause of our pay. For that last year they had been hiring all new people for a couple dollars less an hour than the three of us. So they laid us off and then hired the beloved employee back into another department. I saw my job posted on the website the following with the new salary. ",t3_9hef7a

As they reshit their pants, have the guards explain that there’s been a huge ordeal with knockoff/faulty potions and gear, and that the party looked like seasoned adventures who might have seen something.

Then it works for a good hook, sending them to investigate/take care of a group that sells adventurers fake potions and magical items, scooping up all the gold and items after the adventurers die due to faulty gear.

The feeling you get when you finally killed a much needed elk is amazing. It also has a fantastic way to simulate superstituous beliefs. One of my favorite moments was when i accidentally did not blanch(boil them so they are safe to eat)some poisonous mushrooms and made mushroom soup with them. Started feeling sick, understood my mistake. Went to the local sage to heal me, still felt sick. Took a sauna as my people believe that cleans the body of evil spirits, drank milkweed tea to help filter out toxins. I repeat this for a day or two, i am about to succumb to poison. In desperation i sacrifice some of the leftover soup to the spirits. It makes my character feel at ease. I go to sleep. I wake up and am no longer poisond. I do not know what worked or not. But i am not gonna lie, i jumped up and down from happyness. I put hours into this character, you see. The game certainly made me feel supersituous and gratefull to the spirits for healing me. The game tells you superstituous acts *might* help. Idk if this is true or not, it does not matter i get fully sucked into the world, it puts my character at ease, and in a strange way... it does the same for real life me.

* Eye of the Beholder trilogy for DOSBox. It's a first person dungeon crawler based on the Dungeons and Dragons rules. You bring a party from 3rd level to 18th level over 3 games. It's massive and the puzzles are excellent.
* The Nectaris/Military Madness series on DOSBox, Turbo Graphix-16, SNES, and PSX.  The SNES games are called Earthlight 1 and 2. It's a turn based strategy game that is heavy on the strategy.  Earthlight is all in Japanese, but once you play Nectaris, you can easily figure the games out.  There is so much depth to the strategy, it is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I will easily still be playing it in 30 years.
* Magic the Gathering Shandalar on Windows. This is the collectible, deck building card game set in a roleplaying game world. You start out with a small deck and play computer opponents for ante betting a card from your deck against one of theirs. You travel between towns in a randomly generated world, go on quests, and fight the minions of bosses as you improve your deck. The original cards from the beginning of card game are here including the $25k Black Lotus. A bunch of fans updated the artificial intelligence and added thousands of new cards over decades of the game.  It's the experience of playing Magic the Gathering in 1995, 2000, and 2005.
* XCom UFO Defense for DOSBox and PSX. This is the original turn based tactical strategy game about Earth's defense of a hostile alien invasion with superior technology. The recent, updated version is amazingly good, but the original was just as good if not better. Every stage is randomized and no two games will ever be the same.

Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is my favorite platformer of all time, definitely deserves a ps4 or pc port/remaster. I listen to the soundtrack at least once a week.

Just picked up torchlight 2 randomly on a whim, the rpg elements still hold up pretty well.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a fantastic game on steam, perfect for anyone who like tabletop or fantasy rpgs.

All of the pokemon games in generations 1-4.

Older fire emblems.

Terrarria. Unpopular opinion, but i found the more in depth combat to make this one at least as enjoyable as minecraft.

Fallout 3 and New Vegas, as well as Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Some of the best and most in depth role-playing experiences. Never has a game made me identify with my character like these, especially NV.

On laptop; Rollercoaster tycoon 2, zoo tycoon 2, sims 3, age of empires 2, Morrowind, Stardew Valley, Bejeweled, Duke Nukem.


Consoles;
Skyrim (is that considered old yet?), older Zelda and Pokemon games (also romhacks if that counts, to keep it fresh). Animal Crossing New Leaf, even though I didn't touch it since New Horizons came out. I go through my old Nintendo DS games quite often actually.
I had an awesome Bugs Bunny game, can't remember the name right now, on gameboy color. A few months ago I bought a DS game cartridge filled with GBC and GBA games and loved it as much as I did as a child.


And I have severe nostalgia with the CD-I console (early/mid 90s?), so once in a while I will revisit the Link and Zelda games from that console (my first introduction with the Zelda franchise, only to find out a decade later that you can hardly count those side scrollers as Zelda games, still it's my introduction to the franchise and therefore I love it), some multiple games cd where you play a little santa claus, and a skate game for cd-i, can't remember the name right now.

1. Call Of Duty World at war's campaign probably one of the realistic world war 2 campaign i have played really like the dark atmosphere and music as it really does try to give you this world war 2 vibe p.s I also like the zombie's mode

2. Half-Life 2 w/ episode's perfect sequel of the half-life universe I love the story. and how immerse the world is I really like driving on highway 17 and going to different locations feeling like I'm moving around some of the world and I like how dark it can get sometimes but yet pulls few jokes, ok the last few are little bit more child friendly

3. Spongebob battle for bikini bottom I really do like traveling around bikini bottom going to know locations like jellyfish fields, downtown bikini bottom, and rock bottom and much more the bosses are actually fun which is pretty weird for a kids game, of course, they are easy but are still somehow fun and the music is amazing for a kids game it had an amazing soundtrack especially the bosses I actually got the remake a few days ago still great.

4. The Spongebob movie video game, (yes I am a big Spongebob fan make fun of me all you want idc), same thing with battle for bikini bottom Iconic levels, awesome battles, and amazing music the game is a bit rushed but still a great game

5. Super Mario sunshine love the stages it felt nice and open-world great sequel to super Mario 64 a lot of the bosses are creative and original the final boss was kinda a disappointment to me but still a lot of them were great the music was amazing and a lot of the stages were fun (except for those horrible secret stages and the watermelon those can burn) great game to play.",t3_ifomdz

Super Mario Sunshine is also better than Mario 64, which tends to get a bit more attention. Graphic style still holds up well enough as well.

Older than those, Super Mario World is just a great platformer with some really great early ""video game music"".

Older than that, Burger Time, Pacman, Dig Dug, Galaga...

Super Mario 3 is probably the oldest game that I ever pick up and play.

Faxanadu (NES) is the quirkiest title I replay. Brutal platforming controls, but the art style is really awesome—especially if you ever get to the “mist” world.  Bleak man.

SNES, Legend of Zelda and Super Metroid, so much so they the randomizer is the only way I will probably play. It smashes both games together and mixes items between them. Makes each replay feel fresh. Does require you know where all the possible item locations are, since there is no guides you are SOL if you can’t find a needed item. That said, there are maps that will indicate all the item locations on both games which can help if a key item is in a really stupid place.

3376,g2rkujy,t3_ifomdz,"My childhood self really hopes this post gets some decent visibility. The game that I would like to talk about today is called [SubSpace/Continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubSpace_(video_game)) (downloadable on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/352700/Subspace_Continuum/) or at [GetContinuum.com](https://GetContinuum.com)). Developed by SONY and released in 1997, SubSpace was an overhead spaceship shooter game similar to games like *Infantry* and *Cosmic Rift*. There are many sub-zones within the game, the most popular being Trench Wars, Death Star Battle, Chaos League, and Extreme Games.

Initially a huge hit, its popularity eventually dwindled as console games began to rise up, and SONY inevitably (attempted to) cut the cord. After serious outrage from the robust community at the time, [PriitK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priit_Kasesalu), a player at the time who went on to create and develop major applications such as Kazaa and Skype, chose to keep the game alive by redeveloping it and relaunching it, paying the monthly bill for the servers out of pocket and providing the residual community of several thousands of players a means of playing their favorite game.

Using Trench Wars as an example, there are ***unbelievably*** and ***ruthlessly*** competitive leagues that run once or twice per year, including a squad-based league with 5 vs. 5 and 8 vs. 8 team matches ([Trench Wars League](http://twl.trenchwars.org/?x=history), aka TWL), TWL's qualifying league, [Trench Wars Division](https://twd.trenchwars.org) (aka TWD), the history of which dates back to pre-2000. The most fascinating aspect of these leagues is the record-keeping - I can still go back and see all of the people who I have squadded with since I started playing at 8 years old around the year 2000. If you've gotten this far, [here is a glimpse of the excitement, intensity, tenacity, and competitive nature of TWL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrNZckzyu8Y). Just watch the chat explode.

I am a  successful post-graduate professional and I can say with the utmost confidence that I would not be where I am today if it  not for Continuum. I am also an ex-semi professional FPS gamer and still believe that Continuum is the single greatest video game of all time. This game taught me how to be a leader, how to compete, how to be a champion, and how to become a master at something. Currently, the co-founder/CEO of Postmates (a very long-time player) generously donated $2,000 cash in prizes for the zone to host a [Trench Wars Draft Tournament](https://twdt.trenchwars.com/) (TWDT). We were able to gather 200 signups and have 10 captains draft to play. The league has been incredible so far.

I am dead serious when I tell you that as a current captain this is a second job for me, where the first thing I do when I get home is talk to other captains about trades and practice with my team. It's not even about the money - I just won the TWL basing championship (8 vs. 8) a few months ago for the second time in 20 years and I have a reputation to uphold. The skill curve is so high at this point after 20 years of playing that I cannot be annoyed to lose, and neither can my opponents.

My favorite league is called ""basing"", which is 8 vs. 8 competitive ""capture the flag"". Essentially, you spawn in a flag room and the first team to hold the flag for 15:00 minutes total of flag time wins. In basing, there is 1 terrier, 2 sharks, and 5 spiders (8 vs. 8). The terrier (red ship) is the anchor that everyone attaches to in order to get to base. The gray ship (sharks) are protector ships that repel enemy bullets away and protect the team and also hold the ""cram"", a strategy devised that provides cyclical repels from each shark around the clock to keep the enemy out of flag room. Believe it or not, for about a decade, many squads used a separate strategy called ""lining"" until two legendary squads, -FINAL- and Camisade, implemented and mastered the newer strategy cram - all of the other squads had to adapt or lose, basically. Cram is still the dominant strategy today. Lastly, the green ship (spider) is the fighter ship.

If you made it this far down my post, here are some of the best TWL-B (Trench Wars League Basing) games of all time, in opinion:

[Penetrate vs. Pandora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrNZckzyu8Y) (TWL-B Finals, Season 14) - ***must watch video***

[Pandora vs. Revenge - Round 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd2Klc7f7FQ) (TWL-B Finals, Season 17)

[Cobra vs. Thunder - Round 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SLV94vcoMs) (TWL-B Finals, Season 21)

[Gun vs. Fire - Round 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGLHNdt_Ts) (TWL-B Finals, Season 22)

If you are a true gamer, I ***strongly*** recommend making an account, logging into the server SSCU Trench Wars, and flying around. There are nonstop competitive games with 50-100 people in the arena and a highly contagious chat from 5:00pm EST until 12:00am EST. If you are a more serious player, log in on Sundays at 2:00pm EST until 5:00pm EST to watch the competitive league games.

Again, Continuum  can be downloaded on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/352700/Subspace_Continuum/) or at [GetContinuum.com](https://GetContinuum.com). There are some workarounds for Apple products that you can use to play (please PM me for instructions). Even if 50+ of you joined, you'd be substantially increasing our population. We'd love to have you. Log in and prepare for the most difficult to shake gaming addiction you've ever experienced.",t3_ifomdz

Gen 3 is still a little jank because it's pre-special/physical split, so Pokemon like Gyrados and Gengar aren't at they're full strength, but the games have just the right amount of difficulty to make it interesting. I feel like mild grinding is necessary most of the time (if you play with a full team) and rewarding, but not enough to bore you to tears. 

IMO, I feel like the newest games, Sun/Moon and Sw/Sh are missing something that I've never been quite able to put my finger on, but I just didn't enjoy them as much as the older ones.

Best music, best weapons(the original flak cannon is the most satisfying weapon in all gaming history), reasonably difficult and it has atmosphere like no other video game. Also the story there is simply a bonus, main focus is the fps genre. Even the game starts with no prologue, cut scene or all that time wasting crap. Straight to the action, directly into the core fact that you are a survivor and you want out. And the fictional world surrounding the game? My imagination loves to be given just hints. It's linear but doesn't feel like it at all. You just go through those levels because that's the path you too want to take to escape.

World of Warcraft. 

it’s an old game but still very alive. Ever since it came out it’s been one of those games for me. I go back and play, reminisce on the memories, go through the lore, the whole nine yards. The game, for me personally at least, is so rich and full of content. The new stuff gets repetitive but there’s so much actual game play, you can play for years without playing the FULL game. So many story lines, classes, raids, dungeons, quests, races, etc. There’s book series about the games lore, and even comic books. I have so much love for the game. I take frequent breaks just because other things get in the way and I also have interest in other games too. 

TLDR: World of warcraft is my old game I play regularly. Rich content",t3_ifomdz

I can now play Skyrim and actually do it since a few days, since I changed my point of view from a Gothic competitor to a Fallout in a Middle Ages setting, which I can accept.

They just chased you and tried to hit you a bit, but nothing complicated. Contrast that with cops in GTA that quickly snowball into entire armadas. Midnight Club 3 was more 'realistic', but those cops were kinda boring. GTA's cops were total fiction, but they went a little too far.

With Most Wanted the cops were realistic enough that you could actually get a good sense of immersion, while fictional enough that it was still super fun and entertaining getting chased by them. Most Wanted is the only game where I would purposefully try to make my chases *LONGER*, not shorter. I would be strategic in letting the cops ""find me"" again when I wanted to chase to continue.

Not to mention they really put a lot of thought into the programming of the cops. I used to mess with the audio settings and turn the music, the engine, and other sounds way down . . . and leave the cop chatter way up, because the cops *ACTUALLY* talked about what they were planning on doing. They'd dispatch orders and seconds later they'd follow. You'd hear them say, ""Uh, I've got a green BMW going south-bound of 50. Please advise."" It made it so fun!

No game, for me, has ever had cops that are as fun as entertaining as Most Wanted. Those cops were perfectly balanced!

I got airlifted to a large hospital that had the resources I needed. I spent 3 weeks unconscious, then a month later lost my legs, and then over the following month list fingers and fingertips. I also suffer from ESRD now and some minor medical issues. I also had to get my inner left thigh and the majority of my right thigh skin grafted because all the skin had gone necrotic.

My GRANDPARENTS don't. They once cajoled my crush about how ""back in THEIR day, they used to teach the bible in schools"" and how ""kids these days are so much worse than they used to be because teachers are failing them"". My crush is an elementary school teacher. They knew this. So I'd feel pretty ok with ruining their thanksgiving.

What would happen is that I would say this, they would be shocked and then I'd leave the room to let them stew in the same room with my mom, who they would likely chastise for failing to instill Christianity in me (she didn't, I abandoned my faith), which would piss her off and set her to defending me, leading her to saying stuff about their not so subtle racism, which would piss them off as well as my racist shit for brains uncle (who once told me he'd be Hitler's right hand man, and tried to play it off as a joke when I mentioned the death toll of the holocaust. He also mocked Stephen Hawking's death), who would likely say something about her tastes in a very specific, muscley black body type which would ROYALLY piss her off, given that they're buddy buddy with my mom's ex husband who was abusive and had tried to murder her and threatened her on several occasions (also just generally being a scumbag) but somehow her other ex who they'd just met gave them a bad feeling (he was black, also a piece of garbage but they didn't know that). My uncle is even employed by him. My cousin would defend his dad, my mom would defend me, I would stir shit up with past drama and my political views as well as just being an asshole. I feel like if any of my aunts were there they'd be kinda pissed off at me for starting shit but they're cool and they know about the awful things my grandparents and uncle believe.

Then I'd walk away with a billion dollars. Despite all this, I actually do still love and care about these people. Less than I used to but I grew up with them and they hadn't shown that side of themselves until I was an adult. But a billion dollars is a billion dollars, and they'd deserve to have their day ruined like that.",t3_dwdn5e

4663,f7jvw4d,t3_dwdn5e,"I genuinely feel evil for doing this, but here goes... since my family is kinda fucked up & has slowly separated over the years, I'd have to bring everyone into one place. 

Also, to make this work, I'll have to invite the core members - my father, mother, Oldest Brother, Older Sister, Older Brother. Since some of my siblings have s/o & kids, we're gonna bring them in too - Brother In Law (married to Older Sister), Oldest Brother's girlfriend & their kid (Niece #3), and there's Niece #1, Niece #2, and Nephew 1 from Dead Sister.

The best way to start is to pin my father and my mother against each other. They're married but it isn't the ""adorable/wholesome"" married, but more like the sadder ""you knocked me up, so you gotta marry me"" married. My father is considered my siblings' ""step-father"", so they'll back up mom.

Now, that's just the appetizer. 

The main course will need everyone to turn against each other - brother against sister against niece against cousins against uncles, etc. This is where I start to bring up fucked up things my sister had said about my brother and I. My oldest brother will side with her - they share a father, so they'll have that established sibling bond of ""don't fuck with my brother/sister"" longer than with the rest of us. Niece #1 & #2 might side with me, but might side with Older Sister. They're unpredictable.

Then, I'll bring up our dead sister - a.k.a mother to the grown-up nieces and nephew. She wasn't a good person, tbh, but everyone still misses her (I don't really remember her tho). Hell, let's bring out my dead brother from my father's side - this will have my mom bring up my dad's first wife (who was murdered, from what I've been told) and their fight keeps going and going and going... 

I get my sister and her husband to turn against each other by bringing up her infidelity and challenge BIL's ego & pride... Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.

Now, my oldest brother's girlfriend isn't safe - either. She's gotta join the battle too. I'll bring up that her father is a kiddy diddler and a p\*do, same as her brother. She's not gonna argue with anyone and might've stayed quiet the whole time (she's pretty good friends with my family), so I'll have to take her on myself.

Now, this is when I'll have to bring up the fucked-up family tree dynamics between some of us. My oldest brother has a different father than me (as said before), but his girlfriend is my cousin. He isn't blood-related to her (clan-related maybe), but my mother isn't related to any of his girlfriend's/my cousin's family. His girlfriend's mom is my dad's sister, and so although she's related to me, and my brother is - of course - related to me, they aren't related to each other.

This'll bring everyone to argue the weirdness of their relationship - and my mom doesn't like her bc she thought Brother's Girlfriend was a ""gold digger"" (but, like, where's the gold? brother works in fast food, barely given hours there, so he's like hanging by a thread most of the time).

Now that everyone is thoroughly ruffled and angry, time for dessert. I've had beef with my nieces and nephew since their mom died and my mother took them in - which is nice of her, but she mothered/grandmother over them way more and left me behind.

I can't hold them off forever, I've got two more other's left to bring into this chaos. So, I have to sacrifice dad to distract the Three while taking on mom. I bring up the ol' ""you stole my mom from me"" and slowly hand them off to my dad.

The only two left are Older Brother & Niece #3.

I argue with my Older Brother about why I believe Avril Lavigne died years ago, and the one we see now is a doppelganger. If that ends early, then I'll go into conspiracy theories about sonic the hedgehog (this always seems to work)

Niece #3 will be tough, tho. She barely speaks, so I'll have to baby-babble argue with her and fight over her toys.

My family is also slightly racist towards African American/Black People, which my fiance is.

Easiest way for me to disrupt the family's Thanksgiving dinner would be to tell them our wedding plans.

Which is really just doing a quick court house thing for just me and him. Well with the info left out that we might do a ceremony for family.

My grandparents would be outraged, my mom would be sad, and everyone else around would probably try to talk us out of it.

C- Still lifts the little guy in a stroller/carrier (Says that in strange places it give him a ""Rock"" that if he gets scared, can run to or help him relax, sounds reasonable)

D- My other cousins are total boogers and dicks, treat him terrible, this year especially

E- Stroller Rock is a high chair combo set up next to her at the adult table

F- Giant Turkey is in front of him

G- Aunt in the living room and not dining room cause my Grandma needed help getting out of her rocker

H- Booger Cousins throw a bottle at him

I- Billionaire Cousin retaliates by picking up and chucking the WHOLE FUCKING TURKEY AT THEM

J- Crying. Lots of crying.

K- Uncle of Booger 1 start yelling at Billionare and mom

L- Aunt of Booger 2 slips on turkey as she comes in to comfort her (Slips on grease puddle) and breaks hip

M- Dogs. Just, dogs and meat on the floor. They got bitey, and bit a booger in their turkey frenzy.

N- Smoke detector, cause fire in the kitchen.

O- My dad tries to put it out with water. It was a grease fire.

P- Dad is on fire. Runs to the shower, and ignites shower curtains because of course. Plus towels.

Q- We hear shots from outside. Turns out my sister arrived with my mom in a dinosaur minivan that decided to sound like a machine gun.

R- Grandfather was a vet, and was upstairs. He hears gunshots, dogs, screaming, yelling. He gets a PTSD flashback.

T- I run upstairs to escape the carnage, my grandfather puts a knife up to my throat cause of the PTSD. I shat and pissed my pants.

U- And the worst of it, on top of all of it, was that grandma had a heartattack from all the chaos.

&#x200B;

End result was that after all 4 emergency services were called (Fire department for my dad, ambulance for grandma, police for gunshots, and animal control for dogs) and the biggest argument ever unfolded on the front lawn. Everyone was shouting and blaming others for the fire, dogs, heartattack, turkey, bottle, knife to my throat, and anything else i left out.

That is a Thanksgiving that will live on in complete infamy. And my cousin started that. Grandma is okay, but spent a month in the hospital. Everybody got rattled, but we all smoothed over the whole thing after it all calmed down. Christmas was a mixture of apologies and was honestly really sweet. I got a new game console from my grandfather, we are cool and i understood what happened, so we are fine. In the end we all recovered quite well.

I prepare for the shitshow. Cue people screaming at each other, dramatic exits, and years of pent up family drama all coming out in one spectacular argument.  I have a front row seat to one of the most awkward moments possible.

The icing on the cake was one of my friends drinking buddies coming over a little later, already drunk and oblivious to what just happened. Within an hour he gets more drunk, spews vomit everywhere in the living room (while people are occasionally screaming at each from other rooms) and the grandpa asks him to leave. This divisive event brings the tension right back, and everyone starts screaming again. I get tasked with taking care of the drunk guy, who keeps asking me to drive him to McDonald’s.

We didn’t speak for a year after. When I finally gave in and spoke with him I said how much that hurt me and he said I was attacking him. I really wasn’t, I was being honest and not cruel or vindictive. Nowadays, I never tell him anything negative at all because I’m afraid he won’t talk to me anymore.  Just sunshine. My mom died when I was a kid and I spent most of my childhood caring for my depressed, angry father until he remarried and I was essentially kicked to the curb. Ok. Sorry for the long shitty story.

However even if it does increase your child's risk at autism the kind of protection it provides them from diseases that could easily kill them should be worth the risk. The reason why the average lifespan used to be so low was because so many child died young from these diseases before their immune system was very strong. The only keep thing keeping people who aren't vaccinated from catching most these diseases now a days is because so many people have the vaccination that you are being insulated from a disease that is typically highly contagious since most people will be immune to it meaning your unlikely to be exposed to it.

I have some family members who are part of a church that is honestly probably a cult. We had more success (my parents and I got a few cousins to leave, maybe they would have on their own though so no idea how much of that was us) by attacking the thought process that led to the position rather than the position itself. So for anti-vaxxers - find something you know they disagree with where parents whipped themselves into a hysteria and took a position harmful to their kids based on emotion and ignoring mainstream advice. Get them to see that these people were cherry-picking their data and falling victim to confirmation bias. Get them to agree on how stupid it was that nobody who did this stopped for a second and listened to the opposing viewpoint with an open mind but just reacted emotionally. And very, very gently start showing the parallels to the anti-vaxx movement. If they get defensive just back off and let it be.

Not much, but density is in grams per cubic centimeter, and carats are measured in grams, so to convert we need to multiply that figure by 100^3 (100^3 cm^3 / 1 m^3 is the conversion factor, m^3 will cancel leaving cm^3). The conversion leaves us with 53,222.66 cm^3

Density of diamond, on average, is 3.51 g/cm^3, multipling these two values cancels cm^3 and leaves only g, and we get... 186,711.52 g (186.711 kg, or 411.627 lb)

Converting that to carats (5c/ 1g) we get *934,057.617 carats.*

To put that number into perspective, the largest diamond ever mined is only 3,106.75 carats.

But wait, it gets better.

Minecraft diamonds are a light blue. Blue diamonds in real life are INCREDIBLY valueable. According to www.diamonds.pro a light blue diamond is worth, on average, **$26,280** **PER** ***HALF CARAT.***

applying that to just ONE Minecraft diamond, at 9.34x10^5 carats, gives us a total value of, drumroll...

#$49,094,068,350 FOR ONE DIAMOND

But, considering that I'd be bringing back the largest diamond ever mined, AND it being blue, would likely make it priceless. That's not even considering the fact that I can combine 9 of them into a **cubic meter of solid, light blue, diamond**

And I have 30 days to mine as many of them as I can.",t3_g5cuo2

No need to spend any of it on your house, on food, buying items, etc - you could just spend on the bare minimum, like tools, and then fish & catch bugs and sell purely for profit. Could do the same with fossils - no need to donate to the museum, just sell. 

Also, in the span of a month, you could totally take advantage of the whole growing-a-money-tree thing every single day and harvesting the Bells. 

Not to mention - you could keep some of the stuff you catch or harvest and bring it back with you. Imagine bringing back a freaking coelacanth like it’s nothing!

Minecraft : building a simple base high up in the sky is quite safe. Above an ocean in case I fall, with a small farm and a few animals for food, a bed to avoid phantoms, and a nether portal to spawn pigmen and exit the game with exactly one gold block.
A minecraft block is 1 meter in lenght, and 1 cubic meter of pure gold is worth one billion dollars.  

Outward : you can buy ingredients to craft mana pots, sell those, go to sleep for a few days to wait for merchants to renew their stock, and continue doing that for the whole month, exiting the game with hundreds of gold ingots (but it fucks up the quest timers).  
Also you litteraly can't die in the game (except for one very specific way).  

But if I had to choose, I'd go in No man's sky.  
It's a bit riskier, especially in the first few hours you spend on the harsh environment of the spawn planet, but once you're in space, it's very easy to find a relatively peaceful planet where you can set up a mining operation.

Sims: just avoid fire. Cold food only for a bit. Maybe no woohoo either cause I don’t want a baby following me back to reality. Get a mansion with a pool (don’t swim in it though), pets, look however you want to look, get a dream job (or just motherlode like crazy) and I’m pretty sure you can have magic powers now! 

Animal Crossing: you literally cannot die. Maybe get stung or bitten, but never die. I could just wander about, collecting clothes & furniture for my new home, and depending on the exchange rate, I could be rich af. And theoretically if everything transfers back, I would be able to communicate with animals after!!

Everything: stumbled on this game recently. You can literally have everything, because you become everything. Theoretically you gain the powers of an atom, all the way up to an entire galaxy and every animal, plant, and thing in between. Even some alien things. And again, you can’t die. You just go from being a giraffe to a house to an entire continent to an oxygen atom to an alien planet to abstract collection of shapes and so on. Worst thing that happens is you get stuck in a weird hellscape for a while, but you get out of it. The objects around you tell you how. And at the end, you can communicate with everything. You’re back to being human and your eye hurts? Just ask it whats going on, you’ve been an eye before. You understand. 

(On mobile) Design Home: literally just collect money while designing rooms for yourself and others. You could end up with multiple homes even. You’d have *so* much furniture and art by the time you’re done. Actual, real name brand furniture. Even if you leave the game broke, just sell all of it! Some of that shit is expensive!!",t3_g5cuo2

See the game is pretty much realistic in that it is REALLY hard to level up skills and vocations at the beginning if you don’t know what you are doing, that’s why I chose dark arisen DLC. So what you do is at the start of the game you are given somewhat decent DLC equipment, one of these is actually awful in terms of stats but you can sell it for 742,000 gold coins ( now I’m assuming these would transfer into money in the real world but if they didn’t I’d be worth millions just on that alone). once you create your NPC it unlocks this area that is supposed to be the post games post game called the Bitter Black Isles, and oh boy is this place filled with strong bad guys, so many in fact that the literal best strategy until you hit level 45 is to just buy throwblasts and use those (throwblasts are essentially grenades that one shot any low level enemies and can 3 shot some bosses). 

now what you do is throw throwblasts (buy about 200) until you get to the first safe area, once here there are doors that can only be opened with moon gems which are only dropped by like level 60+ monsters (not really feasible for us to use at this low level) but there is a secret, if you put a barrel down in the corner of the door and repeatedly jump into the barrel while holding something (you can walk through barrels so it is fine) this will allow you to enter the room without fighting the boss, and allows me to get the second best equipment in the game and better than anything in early game, I can get the trophy jacket which is a jacket that is better than most armor SETS, but the two things we are really here for are the ring of perseverance which halves the time needed to level up my class, and the dragons ire bow which will drain my stamina by double until I’m level 47 but is easily the second best bow in the game with its fire enchantment, this will be very useful later. Next I use throw blasts to kill about 25 High zombies or venom canines until I level up assassin class (the most high DPS and range class) to get the most useful move in the game... roll, roll let’s you dodge almost any attack as it makes you invincible for about a second every time you use it, and it is about as fast as sprinting without using any stamina. I use this move to head to the first ridiculous boss... gore cyclops, it is essentially a titan that you have to fight in a giant tower boss room, it takes about 60 throw blasts to kill if you aim correctly and can’t hit you if you stand in the right spot (it literally doesn’t register your existence) so if you stand there and spam throwblasts you easily kill it, this levels you up a LOT (depends on what you use, always use veterans periapts to double EXP since they stack) to be level 50 by the time you kill it. 

now I can use the bow with no drawbacks, the next thing you do is grind for about 20 more minutes (20 minutes isn’t even 12 hours in the game) until your class level is high enough for the two most broken moves In the game masterful kill and hundred kisses, and my augments mean I am now essentially strong enough to beat a normal cyclops which in lore can destroy towns with a single hit in ten seconds, now this alone is enough for me to be a god In our world, but I wanna take it even further, by now I can beat the main boss pretty easily (about 2 hours in the game, about 5 min IRL) to get really broken daggers and make my bow 10 times stronger because of dragon blood but I also equip the ring with the single most scum move in the game... terrible Bend

Now let me tell you what terrible bend does... infinite stun loop, I solo killed the final boss of the game by spamming this move so it’s pretty broken, next thing I do is go to the post game called the everfall, now this place has good armor and masks, but more importantly it has these things called Wakestones, they activate when you die and essentially give you peak health, in lore they return you to your prime physical condition, and in the everfall I can nab at least 20 Wakestones in 2 In game hours, I’d be able to grab a few hundred before the final week meaning I can live essentially a few hundred lifetimes, it’s impossible for me to be murdered since I’m MASSIVELY FTL (the main story boss in lore can travel dimensions in a second based on pure speed and can destroy planets), have auto counter as long as I have daggers and a sword (if I’m in the real world I assume the restrictions of two weapons don’t apply to me)  and as a dragonforged human  I live at the bare minimum 200 years naturally, and since Wakestones return me to my peak character (20) each adds 180 years to my lifespan, a few hundred let’s me live 18,000 years easily. And let’s not tak about how I become an immortal god at the end of the main story. 

But I’m not done yet, I reset the world and head to BBI again (you keep all items and skills after becoming God but can reset the world) I can now stay pretty much Indefinitely but since that’s breaking the rules I’ll just say I have two weeks now instead of one; after getting a second ring of perseverance I can now raise every single class level to the max in three days if I hustle, then by this point I’m level 70 naturally which is enough for me to get level 2 armor and weapons from BBI which are about three times and good as the current daggers and swords or any other class weapons besides my bow. I’m not sure if I could get level 3 relics by the time I leave but I guarantee I could get at least the weapons for each class which are three times stronger than anything that isn’t BBI.

I come back to our world as a billionaire (every trash tier BBI relic is worth at least 200,000 gold with high tiers being worth millions, and in game right now I have 20,750,000 gold in my space pocket since you don’t really use gold after a certain level and considering the gold alone is worth 1,693 per coin (each coin is at least an oz as 100 coins fills a leather pouch that can be used to actually weigh items down) making me worth at least 35 billion

I can also summon meteors and tornadoes, turn beings to stone, instant kill large groups, cause earthquakes that cause pillars to erupt, summon ice pillars the size of sky scrapers, and a whole lot of other things as a sorcerer

I can heal any injury and cure any illness as a mage

I can block any attack and summon a magic cannon as a magic swordsman

I’m basically archer from FSN as assassin 

I can unleash ten enchanted arrows or collapse buildings with the ranger class

I can one shot a literal dragon as a warrior

I am a jack of all trades as a fighter

I can target a hundred beings at the same time as a magic archer

I get a promotion.

The phone rings. I answer. I just got 200 simoleons for winning a contest I didn't enter.

Play video games for 5 hours without anyone caring. Apparently it's a life goal of mine.

What's that? Another promotion. I've only been here for 4 days, but sure.

Practice piano for three days. I can now play Bach.

Get 3 dogs.

After five days of working out, I'm now in peak physical condition.

Cheat on my wife with a girl who recently moved to the neighbourhood. I don't get caught because I can see my wife from a mile away.

In addition, people from all over the world are vying for your attention to heal their loved ones, but because you can only be at one place at a time, many, many people who you could have saved die to their injuries, wracking your with guilt. Eventually, so many people are pleading with you to heal their loved ones that you have to make a horrible choice: continue to travel the world and heal people as a healing-slave for the rest of your miserable existence, or retreat from the world and allow hundreds of thousands of people you could have saved, to die.

I think what makes more sense is that surfaces were created to not be portaled on and it works on most other surfaces. This is because in a lot of the games there are portal surfaces in places that make zero sense, like observation rooms and in the deeper walkway part of the facility which you couldn’t justify painting with moon dust. 
Not to mention that, in Portal 2, you see portal surfaces and are expected to use them to solve tests before the white gel is introduced.
Finally, when Cave references moon rocks being great Portal conductors and he turns it into the gel then if he didn’t have portal-able surfaces before the moon rocks how would he know? How would anyone at Apature know their Portal Gun worked before they got access to moon rocks? Was it just a colourful gun until then? Did they just theorise it could make portals but they didn’t know what surfaces it would work on?

So you level smithing, sell everything you make, wait for the stores to restock, buy more supplies, make more items. It'd be tedious but you could do it. You also pick absolutely every single flower and ingredient you can lay hands on within the relative safety of the riverwood-whiterun region, level your alchemy, and learn how to make fortify smithing potions and fortify enchanting potions. You use up all your ingredients, sell the excess potions you don't need. More money. More supplies. More smithing leveling. 

Then you start the even longer process of leveling your enchanting stat by breaking down items you buy from the stores, enchanting low level items, selling them, rinse, repeat. It will take AGES, but the only goal is to get that tome of transmute. You can roll in to that one bandit camp with 3 pieces of steel armor of the peerless knight, a circlet of health, a ring and an amulet of unfuckinbelievable archery, and a legendary bow of Are You Muggin Me Off. You're now essentially iron man with a delete cannon, and you only have to take out like 6 dudes.

Then you get your tome, and become a real life any-metal-to-gold alchemist when you return to the real world.

Besides DST, my wife and I love playing single player detective games where you need to solve an overarching mystery - we get addicted and we must complete it together and she usually watches and helps solve while I do the actual playing.

* Minecraft (She loves to build, I love to explore and set up farms and shit)

* Resident Evil 5 (Nothing is as ostentatious a show of love as saving your wife from a chainsaw man or vice versa (Edit: Vice versa as in me saving her from the chainsaw man. Though I guess in the end he is the one who truly needed saving))

* Rayman Legends (Good platforming fun. You can easily knock your friends into their death though, so this one is a marriage tester)

* Gang Beasts (With other friends as well. She LOVES this game)

* Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1/2/3 (Finding the first two may be tedious (edit: to find) but the 3rd is out on switch and very solid if you like arcadey brawlers)

* Divinity: Original Sin (1 & 2). Local co-op on PS4 and I think PC as well. We LOVE this game. It's basically D&D in video game form. 

* Dungeons & Dragons. We play 3.5e cause thats what we learned on. I DM two campaigns that she is a player in, and we also play in two other campaigns that are DM'd by different friends of ours. 

* She also just likes to watch me play more cinematic games like The Last of Us, which she was VERY invested in.

Card games like Hearthstone could be easily learned, and surprisingly I learned recently that non-gamer adults find Spyro to be easily learned and enjoyed. EDIT 2: HOLY CRAP I forgot about the Jackbox Party Games! They're meant more for a group of friends to play, but if my bf and I can get our family members to play it with us, you can pretty much drag along anyone to play it. Lots of trivia games and hilarious stuff, you just need one big screen and your phones to play it. 

**If you both like games but one of you prefers to watch as opposed to play:** Literally any horror or puzzle game. Note: Only play horror games if the player is capable of handling the other randomly jumping at nothing or randomly freaking out, no, I'm not saying that as if I'm that person or anything...

**If you're both gamers looking for a fun time:** Stardew Valley, Terrarria, the Halo franchise, Portal 2, Dynasty Warriors/any of their Nintendo spinoff counterparts, Diablo 2/Diablo 3, WoW or Destiny (if you're into MMOs), Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (specifically the Antibirth mod for enhanced fun), We Were Here and We Were Here Too (great teamwork games).

**If you're both gamers and you REALLY want to test the boundaries between fun and rage because whatever:** Overcooked, the older Mario Parties, Mario Kart, Manual Samuel, Cook Serve Delicious! 1 and 2, Octodad, Super Smash Brothers (unless you're playing with computers and items added).

EDIT: I wanted to add if you're both gamers and you are also both fans of puzzle games, The Witness is another interesting game. It's mind-boggling and needs to have an evening dedicated to it, as well as pen and paper. My boyfriend and I did a playthrough of it, and by the end we had a dozen pictures on our phones and 12 pages of scribbled down nonsense like patients in an asylum slowly going through a mental breakdown. This would be under the 'rage' category mostly, but it's by far one of the more memorable experiences I've had with my partner playing video games.

EDIT 3: Jesus fuck I post this on my lunch break at work and get over 100 messages, thanks for giving me a heart attack yall. I kid. Though for real, some of you reminded me of some great games I forgot! For the more complex communicative or rage-inducing games: Cuphead, Surgeon Simulator, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Enter the Gungeon, Bloodborne or Dark Souls if you both have copies of the games. For more accessible, beginner friendly games, or for gamers looking for a fun time: Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, Borderlands; Guild Wars 2, FF14 and Old School Runescape for MMO fans, Monster Hunter World, Payday 2, GTA5 Online, Risk of Rain 2, Rust. For the watchers, visual novel or story games are definitely a good pick: Until Dawn, Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Life is Strange, The Last of Us. I'm 100% sure I've missed a lot of suggestions, so just keep going through this thread honestly and you'll probably find a lot of suggestions for you and your partner to check out.",t3_cw4za2

Overcooked -  My guy and I love it.  It is challenging, silly and fun.  It is also a coop style game so you NEED to communicate, plan and support to be able to complete some of the super hard levels. Supports up to 4 players.

Cuphead - OMG hard, side scrolling shooter game done in the style of 1930s cartoons (hand animated, and a Netflix show coming out soon).  I suck at it but we still have fun with it. For up to 2 players.

Lego games (xbox 360) - Fun, nostalgic, story based and lots of game options.  We are currently playing Lego Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean.

Various emulator games - we have played arcade games on emulator, last one was TMNT arcade, later got to play the actual machine at a convention and beat it.  We have even played games that are older than us (both 37).",t3_cw4za2

She was good, better than she gave herself credit for.  But there were several times I saw she was about to die so I went and died faster.

We also had date nights on Halo 3 Forge.  We had originally met playing Halo 3 with a mutual friend.  It wasn't until the Fable 2 release date that we started talking though.  We realized we were the only other person who was playing it on our friend's list so that's how we got to know each other better.

For some clarification, it was an online only relationship.  I lived in Texas and she lived in Canada.  We never met in person so video games were really our only medium.

We broke up due to distance related issues just shy of a year and a half.  Last I heard she's married.  Hope she's doing well, wherever she is.  I still have her added on Xbox if she ever pops back online again.",t3_cw4za2

The AI will be able to control Heroes, Vehicles, and Reinforcements like the Super Battle Droid And Clone Commando, to name a few. I’m not a fan of the online gameplay because it’s full of bugs, so this is actually a pretty huge step for the game going in the correct direction.

I’m no fan of EA, because they hypocritically abandoned the game back in 2017 due to not gaining enough sales, but it was because it was they’re fault it didn’t. But with the SWBF2 team only consisting of what used to be a large development team, has been a Skeleton Crew and their resources are severely low. With disadvantages like that, it’s amazing what they’ve been able to accomplish this past year. But if your wife/husband likes Star Wars, but in a casual sense wishes to play for fun only, this upcoming Offline mode will be great.

That's just Xbox one, if we really want to play games for an hour or 2 together and trade off, we'll play ""We Love Katamari"" for PS2 and also wii games, both wii sports and like smash bros.

Honorable mention:  Twisted Metal games for PS1....always a classic!",t3_cw4za2

I can hear her saying ""a brawls surely brewin'!"". 

My strongest memory of us together is cuddling in bed playing this game. Arms around each other, controllers in one another's laps. I don't remember what boss it was, but she had been knocked out and I was alone trying to beat it. She cheered me on, both a little tipsy from the wine we typically paired with the game, grabbing my arm firmly during a tense moment, then finally winning. Every detail of the night stays with me, she passed away suddenly from a natural accident about a week later.

7761,ey964vz,t3_cw4za2,"Couple of suggestions that my wife and I tried over the years:

* All of the LEGO games - Great fun to do in coop and also very forgiving. We have played some recent ones although we had more fun with the older entries in the series because they were somewhat simpler in nature.Personal favorites of us are Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Carribean, The Hobbit, Indiana Jones and Batman. We also tried Harry Potter but found it was too complex for our taste.
* Borderlands 2 - probably the game we spent most time in the last couple of years. The gameplay is just fantastic, and the constant hunting for better loot and improving your build is addicting as hell! The game is also very adapted to coop-style gameplay with harder enemies and better loot in coop, and the possibility to revive the other player if necessary, 
* Halo - we've bought the Master Chief collection and played through all of the games. We had a lot of fun doing them, the gameplay is very solid though not as deep as Borderlands (which we played later). We can't wait for Borderlands 3 to come out next month!
* Overcooked - the game to play if you like to put your relationship under some pressure. We played some games in coop, though we enjoyed them more in 4-player mode with friends.
* Mario Kart - great fun, especially when some friends come over. It's intuitive to a degree that even non-gamer friends of us can pick it up and have a good time with it, which is hard to find in a game these days.  In 2-player mode it's more a thing for short sessions to us, my wife tends to get bored of it quickly. But it's awesome for quick rounds.
* Minecraft - building stuff together can be fantastic, though my wife tends to ragequit if she loses all of her stuff due to a surprise creeper attack. We haven't played it since.
* Mario Odyssey - although somewhat limiting for the second player (controlling Cappy is vastly inferior to playing with Mario) it's still a quality game, even for my wife who doesn't like platformers. Spent a lot of hours in this one. 
* Diablo 3 - not our cup of tea. I suggested to try it out after spending countless hours in Borderlands, hoping to get the same deep loot-hunting experience. Turned out we found the gameplay to be overly simple and repetitive, so we called it quits after a few hours.
* Stardew Valley - my wife hated it at first and kept annoying me if I was playing ""that lame game again"", until after several days it suddenly clicked for her and she became very invested in it. She even used to print gift sheets of all NPC's in the game! We played it on Switch, and we have only one, so we decided to take turns - each of us playing one day at a time while the other would provide additional information - or just make tea.
* Pokémon Go - not your typical suggestion, but there's no game my wife and I put more time in during the last 3 years. We spent countless nights driving through a nearby city - one of us behind the whelel while the other was trying to spin stops and catch pokémon on two phones at once. The experience improved vastly after the raid update was released, and we still play this on a daily basis.",t3_cw4za2
7762,ey96a7p,t3_cw4za2,"Beyond Two Souls was an incredible experience for my husband and me. You have a girl and her psychic power (basically a poltergeist) who are two entities and can be controlled by two players. Part of the game's plot is that her power sometimes doesn't do what she wants it to do, and having two players really works well in that respect. It's more of an interactive movie than a video game but it was good. You can also play hot-seat mode if you only have one controller. 

I mean, any multi-player co-op is great. I just got Monster Hunter World for both of us and that's fun. We enjoy Saints Row 3/4 when we're in an immature mood. We also get the opposite editions of Pokémon for them sweet version exclusives.",t3_cw4za2

We quest and level each toon together to have one weaker and one stronger variation.

Neither of us like the crazy pace or culture of current raiding so we do our own thing.

Rdr 2 Online is fun once you get past the greifers. It’s nice to do things as a couple that you couldn’t or wouldn’t do in reality. Like go hunting for bears in the mountains. Or living with gators. And shooting up towns of bad guys, or good guys if you’re that type.

(Online co op)

Any gears of war. These are just some fun shooting games you may or may not enjoy. 

(Split Screen)

Mario kart. This may not be fun and in reality will just test your relationship. Good luck and may the odds be in your favor.

(Split screen)

Halo games. Just another fun FPS game. I enjoy playing this a lot with friends on couch co op. Lots of fun to be had in this game. 

(Split screen)

(Xbox only and soon pc)

Minecraft. A fun exploration game, made for the creative type. Absolutely love this game, there is always room for more ideas to build. It’s fun as a couple to make your own little challenges. 

(Split screen)

(Online co op)

Vigor is a free online survival, battle royal type game. It’s made for duos. And honestly it’s a fun game, that doesn’t even feel like a battle royal. You are put in a decent sized world to face other. Your goal is to collect loot. And an airdrop will drop mid game, with a lot of good loot. You can leave the play area at anytime with all your loot, but if you die, you lose it all, including weapons and ammo.

8456,ey8l9i3,t1_ey8gajs,"> If you both like games but one of you prefers to watch as opposed to play: Literally any horror or puzzle game. Note: Only play horror games if the player is capable of handling the other randomly jumping at nothing or randomly freaking out, no, I'm not saying that as if I'm that person or anything...

Until Dawn is good for this. Generally they like the stories. Me and some friends did it where each of us got certain characters, and would make their decisions.",t3_cw4za2

8464,ey8qp21,t1_ey8eydw,"Definitely this game. My two friends, who are a couple, would play this all the time. My one friend didn't really like playing video games, she would always watch me and my buddy play. But then they got this game and would play all the time.

8465,ey8t5dc,t1_ey8e794,"Wow. This comment really struck me.

Had a beautiful relationship with the one that got away. We played CS GO together a lot, and would do a lot of 1v1 custom maps for practice. I wouldn't even hold back on her, as she was a very competitive person herself. I'd even tease her and make fun of her whenever winning.

Our 3-year relationship survived all that, but the death sentence began when we tried League of Legends together.",t3_cw4za2

However, she finally won her first culture victory on King... all by herself, and was so proud! (I was quite proud too I must admit :)",t3_cw4za2

It has been updated two months ago with Win10 stability improvements and its graphics were optimised so the game runs at smooth 60 fps all the time!

I've been playing it regularly since 2010 and it never ran this smooth.

My first encounter with the game (and I've just lost it) was around 2000 and I've had my own copy since 2002. I played some in the WormNET, got bored after a few years and didn't get back to it. Then, in 2010 my friends in high school claimed that ""there's no way that an old game like HoMM3 or W:A has working official online servers"", then I booted W:A and it turned out to be false.  
W:A even works on Linux with Wine. W:A 3.6.31.0 was working better this way than on Windows!

Old games that are still really fun despite having old/bad graphics.

New games that don't have cutting edge graphics compared to other similar games in their genre, but are still really fun.

In the first category I feel like most oldies still stand up because you're expecting bad graphics and/or you have the nostalgia factor to help you forgive bad graphics. This doesn't quite hold true for some PS1 type games, but most oldies are still fun even with the crap graphics (I'm looking at you Halo 1, you looked way more horrible than we remember, but you're still so beautiful).

In the second category, I mean heck. Tons of indie games just don't have the ability to look like AC: Odyssey but still are crazy fun and you stop caring about graphics. Whether it's pixel art, like in Odd Realm or Aground, simple styles of art like Oxygen Not Included, or just dang good gameplay like Battle Brothers or Prison Architect, I feel like graphics really don't matter as much as AAA companies would like us to think.

**I think more important than the quality of the graphics is the art direction/design in the first place. You can have high quality 32-bit sprites that end up being more pleasing in a game than amazingly rendered faces if it all goes well together.**",t3_ioe4qz

I'm gonna preface with the caveat that I was somewhere around 9 or 10 when I first played it, somewhere around 2000-2001. If you're looking for ""amazing graphics,"" you've got the wrong game. This was during a time where people started to get more shitty and pedantic about graphics, and Nintendo is not known as the company that produces games that make great use of graphics anymore.

However-- if you're looking for a gorgeous aesthetic that immerses you in 5 minutes or less; music that sets a mood and will randomly or not so randomly start playing in your head for the rest of your life (such as what's happening to me *right now* while thinking about the game); NPCs you actually start to form odd attachments considering they're ""just a computer"" (even the animals made me have feelings about their well-being, like hell Janet the cow was gonna die on my watch!); and makes you fee like you'rel a part of something bigger, more beautiful, more fulfilling, with every crop you grow, animal you raise, conversation you have, and festival you attend-- this game has you covered.

You can get married and have kids-- like, yeah, sure, okay, that's pretty cool (and as a kid I did get pretty excited about that)-- but you can absolutely get obsessed with this game without ever wanting or pursuing marriage and kids. You can just... do shit. You won't run out of shit to do, I promise. The number of things you can do is limited only by how long you're willing and able to stare into a screen.

The only thing I think future Harvest Moon games did better/not worse is the length of their days. But Story of Seasons and the newer Harvest Moon series have just about as much personality as cardboard when you compare them to Harvest Moon 64. Rune Factory did a pretty great job of things, but it's also lacking that certain *je ne sais quoi*.

I loved that game. It's second only in my mind to Katamari Damacy-- and most people are like ""wtf is that"" when I bring that up, too. It doesn't get better when I try to explain that ""it's a very weird game where you roll around a ball, and people scream while you roll them up into the ball and turn them into stars and planets at the end of a level, because your dad literally broke the universe and this is the only way to fix it.""",t3_ioe4qz

Helltaker: A silly, well made, puzzle game about an Elvis looking character and a demon harem. If you want to burn a couple hours with puzzles this could do... plus it's free

Minotaur: Does a point and click game with a drawn art-style count? If not go to the next, but this is so well made I feel the need to shoehorn it in. This is a point and click game with an excellent story and multiple routes and endings. It's still in development, but its brilliant and, in my mind, well worth the money. Check out its demo at least.

GTTOD: Get To The Orange Door: This is discount Titanfall with a cool color scheme, and art style. Hard to describe really, at least for my sleep addled brain, but you should check out it's demo at least.

Papers, Please: I'm sure you know this one. Dystopia, terrorism, and... border control? In Papers, Please you play a border control agent in charge of choosing who to allow into your country, but you must be careful. Terrorists and murderers want in just a badly as those visiting family, and a bad call could result in the deaths of innocents... or your pay being revoked. So come report to the Ministry of Admission, citizen. Glory to Arstotzka!

FTL: Faster Than Light: I'm sure you know of this one as well. A space sim with roguelike elements which may unfairly kill you. This game is brilliantly made and has a blocky, but streamlined art style to complement its challenging gameplay. Plus the modding scene is pretty great.

Besiege: You know this one as well, I'm sure. Build janky machines to kill tiny knight things or move things around, or just blow shit up... or whatever. You can also make some impressively complex machines, such as tanks or jets, to do these tasks but I'm too lazy for that. A silly game with a silly art style and replayability limited only by your imagination... or the community's.

Banished: A medieval city-building strategy game. 
Help your settlers survive and build a society by managing jobs, buildings, and resources. A slightly janky medieval colony sim with a nice, if low poly, art style. Probably worth closer to $15 rather than $20, but it's up to you... I enjoy it.

Dead Cells: A Rouge-Souls-Vania action-platformer this absolute must-play is simple game with impressive depth and a beautiful art style that you simply can't go wrong with. Dead Cells will keep you occupied for dozens to hundreds of hours with its engaging combat and challenges, and challenging boss fights. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of the best action platformers on the market.

Terraria: What's Terraria? I've never heard of that, I have no idea what you're taking about. Yes I know its it's obvious (as is what's next) but it had to be done. A 2d action, survival, blow shit up, do a ton of various things sandbox all about building, mining,  and killing bosses; Terraria is a brilliant game that will suck your lifespan dry. Play it if you haven't... you owe it to yourself to experience this modern classic, and some of its awesome modding scene.

Minecraft: What's Minecraft? I've never heard of... okay you get the point. Minecraft is another modern classic that you owe it to yourself to play (I prefer version 1.12.2 and before personally). Similar to Terraria, but more focused on building Minecraft is a big sandbox full of different biomes, creatures, and ores. Not to mention a massive modding community possibly rivaled only by Skyrim.

Starbound: Like Terraria in space Starbound is more focused on exploring than Terraria, and has good reason for it... SPACE! Explore strange new worlds; seek out new life and new civilizations, and boldly go where n... wait that's Star Trek. A nice story greets you, but Starbound is much more a ""make your own fun"" type of game. Combat, mining, building, upgrading, and another cool modding scene, among other elements are aspects of this game that are only complemented by a beautiful art style. This is, imo, another must play to write down in your notes.

VVVVVV: A platformer where, rather than jumping, you reverse gravity. A simple art style with fun gameplay, this game is able to get a surprisingly large amount out of such a simple concept. If you like platformers this is one I'd recommend.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night: Developed under the watchful eye of the legendary Koji Igarashi, this exploration-focused side-scroller action-platformer RPG MetroidVania is a beautiful game with engaging combat, brilliant music, and awesome level design. This game may not count towards the graphics prerequisite if drawn backgrounds and characters don't count, but I feel obligated to recommend it anyway. If you want a bit of Castlevania back in your life this is one of the best games on the market for the purpose, but this is a must play regardless.

TIMEframe: This is more a work of art than a game, but I feel obligated to mention it. Life, death, memory, and civilization are contemplated in this... experience. The game, to be fair, doesn't have much of a story beyond ambiguous clues to the nature of what's happened. The game is more a piece of commemorative art that the developer has managed to wield in a manner that somehow evokes emotion in the player. This one definitely isn't for everyone, it's even priced a bit steeply at $6 in my opinion, but it is a beautiful experience.

Cube World Alpha: RIP to a game that had so much potential, but was bogged down by a terrible, if talented, developer. The full game felt unfinished, and was even worse off than the alpha by many metrics. You can't get access to the alpha, but I thought I'd include this one as it at least deserves a good funeral.

Primordia: Another point and click but this is one I feel obligated to mention. Sapient machines, post apocalypse, puzzles, and story collide in this utterly brilliant work of art by Wormwood Studios. This is something you must experience, brilliant story, and beautiful art describe this perfectly.

Floating Point: From the developers of Gunpoint, this is a 2d game where you make a red ball fly through red pillars with a rope and your mouse. Just a time killer but I thought I'd add it.

There are others, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, Fable - The Lost Chapters, or Morrowind for example, but I didn't want to include games who's graphics were limited only by the year they released. I'm more interested in listing games who aimed for low poly artstyle/story on purpose (though you should play the stalker, fable, and elder scrolls games).",t3_ioe4qz

5 chapters where you play as NPCs in the story and learn about them. Bidoof's backstory, Sunflora and Loudred's rivalry, the Guildmasters origins, a Team Rose adventure, and a super special one featuring Grovile and Dusknoir.

I'm currently not on speaking terms with it because a bug struck me last night that killed a great Persian Empire reform.

I started as Rostab in 867, got my conquer on, managed to go from 3 counties in Daylam to The King of Daylam, Khorasan, and holding a huge chunk of the kingdom of Persia in just his life. Through the power of Feudal Elective and a few well placed duchies, You'd have thought gavelkind wasn't mandatory until the 1200s.

2nd ruler, I have to play more passive as I want the piety to create a new Zoroastrian religion, that allows me to be religious head and call Great Holy Wars, and the only way to expand when surrounded by Muslims as a Zoroastrian is spending all your piety on holy wars.

Well I do all that painful waiting, fend off a few wars as defender to break up the monotony, make my new religion, go to set the religious head title to elective so my heir gets it, and whats this? all I can change is gender preference, no elective options. I figure maybe the issue is there's a limit on how many of your titles can have custom laws (I had 3 kingdom titles at this point all with elective to keep it from the grubby hands of my dissapointing non-heirs), so i test this theory by deleting the law on Persia, nope still no elective laws selectable, and whats worse I can't even give the law back to Persia, its just gender preference as well. I go further and delete all the custom laws, and same thing.

And I wasn't about to vote for whichever shitty dynasty member the game decided was the heir to religious title when I had a Genius heir in the wings, so I did the only logical thing... ~~had to take her out behind the shed~~ deleted the saves in a huff.

People say this but it actually isn't so bad.

With a texture pack and some mods, the game becomes much much more manageable. It's still not super simple by any means, but not too difficult to get into building up a fortress playing the game with some understanding of what's happening.

10307,flesbh2,t3_fobqmw,"Some suggestions you've gotten that are downright bad for a new gamers, and why:

- **Portal 1 or 2**: While 90% is puzzles that take a bit of time but are do-able, there are some complicated parts. If unfamiliar with first-person shooter controls, you might run into an issue getting up a very large shaft in Portal 1, for example, since you'll be required to move the mouse quickly and effectively while flying through the air and aiming new portals

- **The Stanley Parable**: While it's simple to play through, most of the comedy of this game might be lost on someone who hasn't played a lot of games already. It subverts a lot of norms, which is just going to be confusing without knowing the norms and what the subversion of them is supposed to represent.

- **Civilization**: I have to imagine this was suggested as a joke. Don't try to make this your first game. Seriously. It is complex and first-time gamers probably wouldn't even find it very fun.

- **Dark Souls**: You have probably already heard about how terribly difficult this game can be.

-----

Some suggestions you've gotten that are good:


- **Stardew Valley**: There's no rush in it, no real backwards progress so you don't have to worry about failure. It's calming and cheerful, and you can get a feel for progression through actions and how menus work.

- **Overcooked**: It's hectic but it's all in fun. You don't need to know much about menus and there's very little you'll need to learn to start playing immediately. Low difficulty curve to start, but it expands as you go.

- **Minecraft**: Comfortable atmosphere during the day, and for the most part you can avoid combat if you need to. There's a large amount of expanded gameplay once you get into fighting and exploring, but you can play at your own pace fairly easily and learn on your own terms. Apparently there is a recipe book for every crafted item in the game, which is a new addition that makes this do-able as a first-time gamer. *Note: I'd suggest having someone help you out with this if you know someone who has played before*

- **Plants vs Zombies**: Simple to understand, very approachable for first-time or casual gamers.

----

My personal recommendations:

- I'd second **Overcooked** and **Stardew Valley**

- **Firewatch**: A beautiful story, no backwards progression, and a basic UI to get you acclimated to how game UI tends to work.

- **Geometry Wars 1, 2, and 3** (note: Only if you have an XBox controller for your PC): This game can get extremely difficult at higher levels, but there's plenty of fun at lower levels and it's easy to pick up and start playing immediately.

- **Braid**: A simple platformer with a unique art style and some unique gameplay mechanics, namely time reversal.

- **Limbo**: Stylized platformer with some interesting story-telling and world-building you might enjoy. There is risk and some difficult parts, but nothing a new gamer won't be able to get through.

- **Osmos**: Simple mechanic of movement through space and absorption of smaller items to get bigger... but it gets complicated as orbital mechanics are brought in and enemy objects racing to get bigger than you. Very simple to understand once you start playing, and it's very calming during non-competitive levels.",t3_fobqmw

Things were introduced slowly and built in a way that i was able to build the muscle memory to get used to all the different control options.

- There are thousands of options out there, but finding something you can relate to should be the most important aspect. 

- Understanding the skill required to play a certain video game is something everybody has to learn to some extent so that would be the second thing to be aware of. Some games have a high threshold of skill and can be a little disheartening to play if you feel you aren't capable.

- Decide what kind of experience you want, do you want short blasts of energy or maybe a long drawn out relaxing time, perhaps something in between.

- Then maybe  consider if you want a story experience or a more arcade experience. Story-based is self-explanatory, but arcade, in my opinion just means more skill-focus over story. But there is always a bit of both in a video game.

- One other thing to consider would be, how much time do you have to play? Some games require some time to get the most out of, whilst others only require maybe 15 to 30 minutes here and there. All can be played for hours on end of course. But there does seem to be a time:enjoyment ratio at times.

I would suggest something but you dont know me so why would my opinion hold any weight. It would be easier finding out more about you to offer options but i think you might be able to get a few options out of the above 4 things. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions, video games are amazing and i'm very excited for you to get into them.",t3_fobqmw

also, yeah like everyone else ks saying - Portal! Portal 2 has two modes: single player story mode and 2 player cooperative mode. If you like puzzles I also recommend Fez. Myst is available on Steam too. Undertale is fun and kinda retro-looking, a kinda mystery/adventure game.",t3_fobqmw

Minecraft of course is a fantastic introduction to 3-D games that has fairly universal core mechanics and broaches the world of altering the environment around you. 

If you want simpler games that are learned and played through quickly, Fireboy and Watergirl is a simple online puzzle game built for two players. It's a great introduction to the arrow keys, WASD, and overall 2-D platforming. Online games are great for a BRAND NEW player that hasn't really even touched WASD in the context of gaming. 

A nice MMO with a fair learning curve is Tanki online. That will introduce you to multiplayer combat and class-based game-play. 

These are simply recommendations. Maybe you fall in love with all of these games and become the best in the world. Maybe these are a mere step in the staircase to bigger and better things. Either or, those four should all be somewhat easy starts for your insertion to the gaming world.

- Mario Kart
- Super Mario Odyssey
- Marvel’s Spider-Man (on easy should be doable, great story! This was my first Playstation game and I was so scared because PS games to me are for like, pro gamers)
- Any Animal Crossing game! (If you’re patient and like seeing hard work pay off gradually + cute animal friends!) 
- Splatoon 2 (practise your FPS skills! Super weird and funny and charming. I never thought it would get me hooked but I have 600+ hours on it, and I suck at FPS)


If you want a beautiful story that will get you hooked you can try these out on the Story setting. Playing these first might make some other games feel hella wack by comparision though. But I strongly urge you to experience them! 

- The Last of Us 
- God of War
- Horizon: Zero Dawn 
- A Plague Tale:  Innocence

Do you want a game that will tell you all the rules and guide you straight out of the gate? Or do you want to explore and figure stuff out on your own?

Do you like the idea of repeating the same sorts of actions over and over to achieve goals, or do you prefer to try new activities frequently?

Do you want lots of action and excitement? Or maybe just to unwind with some more mundane, relaxing activity?

10467,flf5kef,t3_fobqmw,"My advice is to narrow down what you like first, then search for games that have that as an element. The beauty of the way the gaming world works anymore is that you're guaranteed to find something made for someone who likes the things you do. Don't limit yourself to one game, either;  there's a wide arrange of styles and genres that you can experience, so if one type isn't quite tickling your fancy, you can try something else.

Since we're talking middle-age (I'm almost 38 myself, but I've been a gamer since I can remember), focus on something you'll be able to play quickly that doesn't require a time sink. After all, you've got work, a family, housework...the last thing you want is something that requires days to complete.  For the specs you've got, anything 5 years or older shouldn't have a problem running.

I, for example, tend to focus more on RPG style games because I dig the stories and customizations they usually allow, but my wife is very much a linear ""goal-oriented"" gamer - she's gotta have a clear structure and goal to work to or she loses interest quick. The Ori games have been our go-to that we both like, but make sure your card can handle it first.

My favorite times with my oldest was during at my desktop playing music while he sat on the couch and played his games. I got you watch the amazing games and he got to learn about classic rock n roll. I built up an amazing playlist. 
Now my youngest and I don't do this cause he plays on handheld devices.
 The 3 of us like to play PS3 MX vs. ATV. Simple game. We ride freestyle. Very open environment.
We also play portal 2. You have to shoot holes to portal around the game and solve puzzles. 
My oldest and I play metal gear solid and prove off Persia and grand theft Auto. There several versions of each. 
We also play games like snake only fancier. You glide around eating smaller things to get bigger until you're too big or something eats you! Very relaxing. 
Call of duty is very popular here as well as fortnight and Minecraft.

Decide if you like puzzles. Action. Sports. Or making long snakes. 

Remember you'll never be as good as kids cause you're not wired for this. 

You can't really make mistakes cause you just come back to life over and over.

Here is a list with some info:

Steam: The number one launcher of them all, this alone has the biggest library of games. Most players will recommend this one as it is the oldest  and best one. But most of the popularity comes from all the big sales. Keep an eye out for them and read the reviews first before buying a game.

Epic Launcher: Many people hate on this one because they are aiming to become the next Steam trough very aggressive marketing. Doesn’t mean it’s bad though as this launcher will give you 2 free games per week! And it houses the insanely popular free game Fortnite (Not a game for starters tough)

Origin: The get go launcher for all EA games. EA is one of the biggest companies with greedy tactics but still has a number of awesome games like the sims or fifa. Not realy recommended unless you like a game that is distributed trough here.

GOG: A launcher that aims for drm free content. This means that when you buy the game you own the game. To compare it with Steam, many people are afraid that when Steam stops existing, you’d lose all of your games. This launcher is also different from the other by having a solid library of very good classics.

There are other smaller launchers like Blizzard launcher but they only contain 4 to 5 games from one developer.",t3_fobqmw

Minecraft is a nice game that is only as complicated as you make it.

Redstone can be as simple as a pressure plate infront of a door, or as complicated as a walking house

You can kill monsters with a sword or make an automatic monster killing tower.

You can make nice looking things like grian, complex machines like mumbo jumbo, or make massive game breaking farms like ilmango.

If you want more of some button mashing where you dont really have to think, I'd recommend Castle Crashers. A simple, cartoon style game with a fun story and maybe four buttons to use and it's not overwhelming. 

As far as scary games go, I cant recommend the Outlast series enough. You can't fight your way through enemies so it involves you outsmarting them and using your trusty camcorder to help see in the dark. It's a very suspenseful game tho so be wary with it.

If you like puzzles a game called Hello Neighbor is very good. I cant remember if that's the exact title though so please correct me. It's a little suspenseful like outlast but nevertheless harmless with you never seeing actual violence if I remember correctly and the art style looking like a kids movie. The premise is you sneaking into your neighbors house and finding out his secrets. But the catch is that the neighbor learns from your tactics and you always need to come up with something new to get in his house.

None of these games should be overwhelming as far as controls go. But they will teach some of the basics for other games that match up in their respective genres.",t3_fobqmw

Seriously though, it depends on what sounds interesting to you. Top comment is Mario, and that's probably the best choice for starting with a platformer.
 If you like strategy, I'd recommend xcom: enemy withinIt's my personal favorite strategy game, and it's basically complicated chess.
 Minecraft is a fun creative outlet, and if that's not your jam you can play survival mode and do that. 
For a first person shooter, if recommend halo, and just play on east until you feel more comfortable with the controls. Easy mode is pretty forgiving, and it introduces concepts that many newer games use, like regenerating health, or bungie's older game, Marathon. It's very much like doom, but it has a story. It also has a forgiving easy mode. It also has BOBs yelling ""frog blast the vent core!"" 
There is a genre called ""Metroidvania,"" which is a blend of Metroid and Castlevania. There are good ones in both series, but for starting, is recommend guacamelee. 
For an adventure/rpg I'd reccomend dragon age origins. That game has an interesting take on combat. You get a party of 4 character, whom you meet along the way, and you can control one character at a time, but you can pause the game, and play the combat as if it were a strategy game. You can zoom out and see the whole field and tell your guys what to do, and then fast forward until you want to tell them to do something else. It's similar to d20 rules; elves, mages, etc. I liked the story, but it might be considered more complicated than what you may be looking for. If you want a more straightforward rpg, 
check out Skyrim. 


Super Mario brothers - platformer

Xcom:enemy within - turn based strategy

Minecraft - creative outlet/simple adventure

Skyrim - more complicated adventure

Dragon age: Origins - complex rpg, but most similar to d20 on this list. (Baldur's gate is a good one for 
GameCube or PlayStation 2 which IS d20)

Halo - first person shooter (modern)

Marathon/doom - old school first person shooter (Marathon for story, doom is good too, but less story focused)

Guacamelee - Metroidvania (platformer mixed with exploration)",t3_fobqmw

I'd avoid anything MMORPG -- because some people dedicate so much time to them- and you commoly have to keep up... I""ve always found them to demanding... but many friends who enjoy them.

I would heavily recommend any Animal Crossing game, in the same vein as the Stardew Valley recommendations, as it is relaxing and you can set your own goals at your own pace while figuring out how video games work.

Then I would recommend any of the Zelda games. They do a great job teaching you how to play, fostering experimentation and learning from mistakes, while also delivering a fiction that is equally interesting as it is easy to understand.

In general, a lot of video games today have aspects to them that Nintendo invented and perfected and you will learn a lot by playing their games that will help you understand how every other game in the industry works. Nintendo is essentially the baseline for understanding how games work.

My advice would be to search for ""genre staples"" instead of specific games, to get a feel for what *kind* of games you enjoy.

I'm going to assume a grown adult would have some kind of computer with reasonable specs, so to prevent you from purchasing a gaming console, you'd want to get a Steam Account for your PC. From there, search the store page for broad genres. ""Platformers"" or ""RPG"", ""FPS"", ect.

Find a good rated, cheap one of each (that your PC can handle) and give it a go. While you might not always enjoy every game of a genre, one or two games should be enough to get a good feel for if you like the genre at all.

Brother: A tale of two sons

A puzzle adventure game played best with 2 players. Really great and heartfelt story.

Simple, but all 3 of you can play together and its probably the best sandbox game out there, quite possibly one of the best games in the world. Can also be played singleplayer if you would prefer. Also if you do get really into it there is a massive amount of community support for the game and it will almost always be worth its value.

A singleplayer open world fantasy game, I would highly recommend it to see if you are interested in first person action role-playing games.

Castle Crashers

A relatively short, humorous beat-em-up that is easy to get into and isnt hard to understand.

Fez

A fun indie game that tests your puzzle solving skills and spatial understanding. Cute graphics and quite cheap.

Terraria or Minecraft are good. You can sink many hours into that. If you have another PC in the house you can play online together. 

I'm a bit rubbish with computers and their spec but if you can the Sims games are great. Even if your PC won't run the latest Sims (Sims 4 I think?) the previous versions are good too.

Terraria is a more immersive experience than that IMO but it’s harder and requires more knowledge.

If I had to say one single game go play an older Pokémon game. Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow, Gold/Silver/Crystal, Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/FireRed/Leafgreen, Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/SoulSilver/HeartGold. Pokémon games are easy to get into and with older games there’s not as many Pokémon. Gen 1 is 151, Gen 2 is 250~, Gen 3 is 380~, Gen 4 490~. I’d recommend either the 2nd or 3rd Gen to start. To clarify by Gen (Generation) I mean which set of games to choose from I grouped them up by Generation. 

One of my favorite games is Stardew Valley. It is the most calm game ever.

If you want action go play Rocket League. Car soccer. Easy to play hard to master.

10886,flg3cqe,t3_fobqmw,"What do you like? 

In general, it's really easy for us who grew up playing video games to underestimate just how *hard* they are to control. The best way to avoid that, without having to recommend ""easy"" or simple games, is to explore genres that how a low execution threshold. I've been trying to do something similar with my past middle-age father, and this is what I've come up with.

First, there's an absolutely brilliant puzzle game called **The Witness**. It's really unique, so it's not a great way to ""ease you in"" or anything, but it's a strong showcase of good game design.  No jumping, no running, no pixel-perfect anything; just thinking and exploring. It's very plodding and methodical, and also very heady. You'll also have to get used to very lateral thinking.

**Disco Elysium** is also great, and again, very low *dexterous* execution, but unlike a lot of other Role Playing Games, the stats and numbers have been rethought to not only be more interesting, but also more intiutive. It's an old-fashioned RPG in other ways, though, meaning lots of walking around and talking to people, inspecting things, and thinking about your options. Very dull for some people. Luckily, it's very well-written and well illustrated, so you'll hardly be bored.

Finally, if you have a friend you'd like to play with, I recommend **A Way Out**. Not because it fits these criteria, mind you, but just because it's such a singular and amazing experience that I recommend it to everyone. The only thing I will say is make sure to play with the same person the entire way through (it's not that long). I guarantee you that it will be the best movie you've ever played. It's not very hard, and even then, I think there's an easy difficulty. 

If you want just a smattering of very good games irrespective of whether or not they are easy to get into, then I can give you those. 

Let me also say as an aside, you can't really go wrong with Nintendo. If you're worried that they're like Fischer-Price games for babies or something, you don't have to worry. Ask 9 out of 10 gamers, and they'll tell you that Mario Odyssey, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and a fair few others are some of the best games of the past few years.",t3_fobqmw

&#x200B;

I would recommend some old classics that really kicked off a genre and are great for new gamers especially middle aged ones who saw these games on commercials growing up but just never played them.

&#x200B;

First off, if you have access to a PC I would download Steam as a lot of classic games have been ported over. Second, if you do have a Switch or have intentions of getting one and would like to invest in the online, get the membership as it comes with Nintendo Classic and Super Nintendo apps that allow you to play older games from a generation you might be more familiar with - which is totally ok. If not, it might be worth reading about emulators.

&#x200B;

So I'll go down a list of games, really focusing on the classics and genre-definers so you can gradually work yourself into gaming, get a sense how gaming has changed or has stayed the same. I'm going to stick with Nintendo to keep the list reasonable.

&#x200B;

**Nintendo (NES)**

The original Zelda and Mario games are great starts. Both provide easy to play game play with an increasing curve in difficulty that you get used to as the games progress. Zelda 1 gives you a bit more sense of exploration and adventure since nothing is directing you explicitly. Mario 1  is a great introduction to the side-scrolling platforming genre. Mario 3 takes concepts from Mario 1 and just throws an entire world at you to play through.

Metroid 1 is an amazing, expansive game for a game that came out in the 80s. A massive map with back and forth puzzle mechanics to explore and work through. Overall a great classic game.

Castlevania 1 and 3, if you want a harder platforming game, there's no better original game then this series. Controls can be clunky, mechanic finiky, but the boss battles and level designs make it all oh so worth it.

**Super Nintendo**

Super Mario World is an amazing starter game that starts off easy and gradually introduces more difficult levels, with the addition of secret paths and levels to discover as you play. A great introduction to discovering more then what lays beneath the surface of a game.

Zelda: A link to the past really is a build up off the original NES games, adding story and much more intricate dungeons and boss battles with a whole host of new items to discover.

Doom, is one of the original FPS, and one you probably saw on the media quite alot over controversies ""too much violence"". It's a great FPS with plenty of action and secrets to discover, a trend which continues into all past and present Doom titles. If you're going to try this one, I would recommend picking it off Steam or another console as the SNES port is poop.

Any RPG on the super Nintendo is great, and are great introductions if you want to get into more story driven games in the future. I personally recommend Chrono Trigger for this one. It's fun, not entirely grindy, has an amazing story with awesome game play and side content to unravel more of the story behind the scenes if you so choose.

Super Metroid, is a beefed up version of Metroid 1, and highly recommended to play as many many games have taken inspiration from it's level design and game play philosophies.

Super Castlevania 4, another beefed up version of the originals and is taken to another level. better controls, level design, boss battles are fun and rewarding. Highly highly recommend.

There are so many great games on this console.. Mega Man X, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana...

&#x200B;

**Nintendo 64**

Zelda Ocarina of Time and Mario 64. Beefed up, genre defying games that have literally set the tone for more of the games that have come since. Gaming classics and truly works of art and important pieces of gaming history. If I could recommend just two games on this console, it would be these.

Golden Eye, the big FPS of the N64 which gave birth to another amazing FPS, Perfect Dark, and all those that came after. Plenty of action, secrets to find, and challenges to complete. Great game.

&#x200B;

The N64 just has so many great games to start with that it's so hard to make a list of all of them, so I've just stuck with 3-4 that really anyone I knew growing up or in the school yard had played atleast once.

&#x200B;

Here is a list of newer titles that anyone getting gaming should play, mostly on Steam as they're cheap and very accessibly. This are mostly for ""normies"", so you wont get any indie games as those are games you'd eventually branch out into as you pursue games throughout different genres you like. Gaming is yours to discover and despite me writing a huge list and saying what might be best, we all have our preferences on what should be the best game to play . Gaming might be considered ""nerdy"" to some, but it's a whole world with a rich history and culture behind it. 

&#x200B;

**Steam**

Portal 1 and 2

Doom 1-2, + 2016 and Eternal if you want the newer titles

Any of the Elder Scrolls games, 3-5 are great.

Halo 1-3

Half-life 1 and 2 + all episodes

Age of Empires 2

Starcraft 1 and 2

Diablo 1-2, 3 is ok but 1 and 2 are the staples.

Fable 1

Warcraft 2 and 3

Bioshock series

Any Final Fantasy game, minus 11 and 14 unless you like online

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And since alot of people are recommending the Switch..

**Switch**

Zelda Breath of the wild

Mario Odyssey

Mario Kart/Party

Super Smash Brothers

10939,flgjst2,t3_fobqmw,"The first question is really, do you have a gaming system or PC. If so which. In general if start out with a kids game. As u/cutebots recommended, something casual. I always feel kids racing games like Mario kart are basic enough to have some fun with.

I'm happy to provide a more in depth response. But from personal experience as a long time gamer dating someone who doesn't play games, this can be difficult. I've learned games I thought were basic are not. Things like controls are second nature to me anymore. They seem natural and basic. I've learned they are not. As such:
 I'd stay away from anything first or third person. They are a lot of fun to be sure, but they often require you to use one set of controls for movement and another to look around. Then you add in action controls and you can get confused on just the controls. I'm not saying you will. But if you want to enjoy the game try and find something basic. Also, what are you interested in? What do you enjoy. How about board games or other games that aren't video games you enjoy?

For instance I enjoy settlers of Catan, risk, and other strategy games. I find RTSes to be a lot of fun as a result. I also find turn based strategy to be fun. Games like Warcraft 3 or StarCraft 2. Something like Xcom for turn based. Steam has a bunch of good ones. There are mobile games as well. I'd even say fallout shelter is a good starter.

Stardew valley, Starbound, and animal crossing are also fun games. I like the first two because you can start basic and as you become more comfortable there is room for expansion into complex game play. I've tried to make most my recommendations on things that are complex, but can also be simplified and enjoyed.",t3_fobqmw

10941,flgk4d4,t3_fobqmw,Try Tekken! It's a good start!,t3_fobqmw
10942,flglq04,t3_fobqmw,"It really depends on what exactly this middle aged man is interested in, in other media. For example, if he likes old westerns, maybe find something that complements that.

So for specific genres, here's what I would say:

Western RPG: I would suggest Skyrim. My reasoning is that it's fairly easy to control and get used to and offers a lot of flexibility in playstyle. Start him on easy mode and he should get the hang of it pretty quick. It's even more intuitive in VR, if you have that handy. Although, VR might be a pretty huge first step for someone in that demographic.

Japanese RPG: Final Fantasy X. Japanese RPGs are well known for their extremely rich stories, especially Final Fantasy. I picked FFX out of the series because it's strictly turn-based, and you can take all the time you need to pick out what you want to do next. FFX has quite a few challenges in it too, so he'll have some things to test his knowledge without truly overwhelming him. It'll keep him on his toes, so he'll always have the feeling of improving over time. I would also put Undertale (its style is JRPG, even though it was made in the West) here, if he's looking for a much shorter (and more light-hearted) experience.

First-person Shooter: I'm not huge on FPS games, but the easiest one I've played was Team Fortress 2. TF2 might turn someone in that demographic off though due to its cartoonishly graphic nature. So if he's not keen on the gore, maybe Halo? I only played Halo once when I was really little so I can't really speak to its accessibility.

Puzzle: Contrary to popular belief, I would say Portal 2. It has some difficult moments, but it's a great introduction to FPS mechanics and offers loads of lateral thinking puzzles. No time crunches, so he'll have plenty of time to solve each puzzle without feeling stressed. Then there's also the really fun characters and comedic dialogue to keep him entertained.

Horror: Starting a middle-aged man on horror is definitely risky, but horror is also more effective at making a more lasting impression on someone, for better or worse. I would say for the best first time horror experience, it would have to be Silent Hill 2 or 3. Very simple controls, though a tad clunky, and they have adjustable difficulties. Just make sure he's already into psychological horror (The Thing by Stephen King, The Shining, Call of Cthulhu by H.P. Lovecraft, etc.)  in other media first. Otherwise, it's best to save this genre until he's got a few more games under his belt.

Sandbox: Minecraft, obviously. It's the de-facto sandbox game that has the incredible ability to resonate with all generations. Its controls are extremely simple, and it has difficulty options, even one where you can remove all enemies. It has an in-game crafting book now too, so no more looking up recipes on the Minecraft wiki. Great game to start someone off with. If you want a different answer, then I would say The Sims or Terraria.

Adventure/platformer: In this genre, it's best to go with something familiar. Super Mario Bros. is a great one to go with, but if that's too old for him and he wants to experience something newer, then maybe Super Mario Galaxy. Again, super intuitive controls, beginner friendly, and very simple premise.

Obviously there's other genres but this is what I thought of off the top of my head. I highly recommend all of these games to anyone who hasn't played them, but whenever I introduce anyone to video games, these are the ones I always start with. I also like to introduce Dark Souls early on, mainly because while it can be challenging, it really helps with encouraging skill improvement and increasing confidence once they figure things out. That confidence can carry over to other games and make them not as afraid to tackle new things.",t3_fobqmw
10943,flgs7h2,t3_fobqmw,"Stardew Valley.

Not a lot of risk, doesn't really require fast reflexes - even the mines aren't super dangerous and the consequences for being knocked out there are mild. Lots of good information on the wiki. But it will get you used to the controls, the WSAD+mouse or controller setup is similar to most games so you can easily transition into less forgiving games down the line if you find you enjoy it. It also has multiplayer (though not local), and is on all consoles including mobile which should make it easy for you and your family to play together.",t3_fobqmw

They're generally good enough to play and ""occupy time"" with kids (probably 10+ to be fair, though maybe a little younger too), and they have ""duel mode"" so someone can join in and play along.

My personal favorites are the Harry Potter series, and City Undercover.

The Harry Potter series is very cute and follows the story pretty well, overall. There's nothing but grunts and groans from any of the characters (licensing, perhaps?), but the music is taken from the movies. Still, lots of puzzles and hidden objects for you to find, throughout the game.

City Undercover is probably best described as GTA V for kids. It's an Open World with ***lots*** to do, having 450 ""yellow bricks"" to find (which is more than double the typical 200 blocks, of others). Even better, as it has a ***great storyline*** with plenty of parody moments from other drama/adventure movies, and old 1970s cop shows/series. It took me about 30 hours to beat the game (read: finish the story), but I'm still only about 70% complete at nearly 40 hours of game time.

I've also played the Star Wars and Batman series, but couldn't really get too much ""in"" to them. I have the Star Wars series done through the initial trilogy, and that's where it currently sits... I'll go back to it, someday.

There are also plenty of other series to be had, and all of the mechanics are about the same... they've just ""matured"" a little bit more in the more-recent releases. And again, some of the best fun with it are the ""co-op"" opportunities ... though sometimes it makes solving a puzzle mode difficult, when you have a stubborn kid, not willing to ""give up"" a particular character needed to progress the story.

For puzzle games, Portal or Antichamber are great at being unique whilst also an interesting way to show yourself what kind of potential this sort of stuff has. For economy games, you can’t go wrong with Slime Rancher, but Stardew Valley also has a pretty big money making side to it. The Stanley Parable is a classic and is amazing for people who like details and thinking outside the box. If you’re looking for a more complex way of starting off, while also still being easy enough to get the gist of, Factorio is great, and, while it may not be the best game to start off with, Trigger Happy Havoc fits into that category. Hearthstone is just about as welcoming as it gets, Undertale is a good second RPG to play, if you’re looking for really casual games, Octogeddon and Plants vs Zombies are great. Don’t Starve is a really flexible survival game, as you can make it as easy or as hard as you want in pretty much any way by changing the world settings, and it really does have the survival feel that clicks pretty well with anyone interested in survival. The Sims, Sonic Mania, Spelunky and Minecraft are great introductions to their respective genres, and, lastly, I wouldn’t forgive myself for not mentioning Terraria. So there you have it, a complete list of rambles about a 15 day old question.",t3_fobqmw

10985,fmwpiyl,t3_fobqmw,"Depends on the platform you’re using and the amount you’re willing to spend. 


If on PC, try World of Warcraft. Tons of different types of content you can experience at your leisure, and perhaps enjoy with some friends too. 

PS4: Try the Uncharted series. Keep the settings on very easy so that you can enjoy the story. 

If you want something a little different, pick up an oculus quest and try Robo Recall (though I got one to play Half Life: Alyx using the oculus link) 

Nintendo Switch: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Beautiful game. 

Mobile (Android/iOS): Try hearthstone for a change of pace. There’s also Xcom, Her Story, Life is Strange, and a ton of others. 

Let us know which platforms you’re planning on playing on, and whether you prefer story-driven games, competitive ones, laid-back building kind of games, etc etc. There’s tons more we can suggest.",t3_fobqmw
10986,fmxwqmz,t3_fobqmw,"For first person shooters, start with Minecraft. It will teach you the basics on how to move and look around, and is not that hard on peaceful. Another good game is SUPERHOT, which can help you learn movement as well. Then move on to games like CSGO, TF2, Overwatch or even phantom forces. All really easy games to get into. Once you have around 200hrs try COD or battlefield. After that you then have a lot of options. Battle royales like PUBG, Fortnite or Apex, milsims like Escape from Tarkov, Squad or Arma or even survival games like Rust and Dayz. But before you do all of that, watch videos on the games you are playing daily and play with friends.",t3_fobqmw

-----------------

**Portal 1 and 2** - Thought by many to be the best videogames ever made. On top of that there is an ongoing discussion whether playing videogames can increase IQ and Portal is at the centre of that. The puzzles are great, the humor top notch.

&nbsp;

**Age of Empires II** (Go for definitive edition) - An all time classic that got a remaster not long ago and I wholeheartedly recommend it

&nbsp;

**Minecraft** - Praised for being to have broad appeal for people that have never played games, and for all ages

&nbsp;

**XCOM Enemy Unknown / ""XCOM Enemy Within"" / XCOM 2** - Absolutely fantastic turn based games where you can take your time while being immersed in a great story and world. In XCOM you are humanities last line of defence against invading aliens, in XCOM2 you lead the resistance. If you don't have a more or less powerful computer go for the first recommendations

&nbsp;

**Bastion** - A top down isometric adventure game with a unique aesthetic, good gameplay, music and a unique narrator

&nbsp;

**DOOM 2016** - Distilled pure shoot them up adrenaline. Be sure to play on the easier difficulties. A new installment of the series came out but from what I can see it's much more complicated than the 2016 version

&nbsp;

**Tomb Raider 2016** - Just a well crafted first person adventure game

&nbsp;

**Wolfenstein The new order** - Same as Doom but instead of shooting demons you shoot Nazis in a parallel universe where they won the war and have advanced technology. There's more story but it doesn't shy away from being a video game.

&nbsp;

**Bioshock Infinite** - Slower gunplay, great story in an imaginary retro steampunk world floating in the sky

&nbsp;

**Spec Ops:The Line** - Below average first person shooter gameplay, great story exploring difficult themes set in a contemporary setting in Dubai

&nbsp;

**Anno 1404 Venice / Anno 1800** - Slow paced, great atmosphere city builders, anno 1800 is more demanding graphically but generally I feel improves on 1404

&nbsp;

**Cities:Skylines** - A city builder set in today's world

&nbsp;

**Frostpunk** - A city builder but it's the end of the world, you might need an okayish computer for this one

&nbsp;

**FTL: Faster than Light** - An indie game with retro graphics and a great soundtrack of you piloting a spaceship running away with important plans

&nbsp;

**Tomb of the Necrodancer** - Faster paced, dungeon exploring rhythm game

&nbsp;

**LIMBO** - A dark, simple, atmospheric adventure game

&nbsp;

**Rayman: Legends** - Platforming with great visuals and gameplay, more fun with a couple people as well

&nbsp;

**The Walking Dead** - A point and click adventure that will leave you wondering just how the hell did they make such a polished game in which you can direct the story so much

&nbsp;

**Company of Heroes / Company of Heroes 2** - Historic real time strategy in world war 2

&nbsp;

**Skyrim** - An open world fantasy adventure

&nbsp;

**The Witcher 3** - Much more complicated but better crafted than Skyrim open world adventure

But seriously it depends on what you want to play. Some games have very basic controls and some games let you make the difficulty setting really easy. I think it would be easy for you to pick up any game that isnt specifically for online multiplayer.

Also what are you using? A computer, Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo console, phone? Some games are only on specific platforms. You could always go with something older, like a 2D Mario, Sonic, etc. type of game. Or if you want something basic like a sports or racing or fighting game. Or if you want a game to play for the story or something more recent you have a lot to choose from.

It’s very much a cult classic, I have literally seen Aperture Studios (the game designers) bumper stickers. They have a portal 2 out now that is even better than the original IMO. I was able to get my 65-year-old father into it on PC because he can’t use a normal controller due to having only two working fingers on his left hand.

Edit: didn’t read the comments before posting and I am very happy to see so many others recommending this game, OP You really should check it out. Also I don’t know if it’s available on PC because I’m really not a big gamer but one game that I enjoyed so much throughout the past three decades of taking advantage of friends and family members consoles was a PlayStation 2 game I believe, called “Shadow of the Colossus” In a way it was also a puzzle type game. You travel around on a horse through a land riddled of mystic ruins looking for giant enemies/beasts sometimes as tall as skyscrapers trying to figure out how to defeat them.

Stardew Valley- it's available on PC and smartphones (since you said that you have no consoles), I have nearly 200 hours on it on my Switch, and it's very beginner friendly because of how chill it is. It's a farming game where you can build up relationships with all the people in the town, and the developer regularly puts out really beefy free content updates.

Only downside is that multiplayer only works between copies of the same version, so you'd only be able to play it with your family if you all bought copies of it for the same system (like you all got it on different PCs or you all got it on different phones). However, you can also take turns by opening multiple saves in the same copy.

Keep Talking and No One Explodes is a fairly stressful game, but it is good for building up communication and you only need one copy for multiple people to play. It's a bomb diffusing cooperative game where the person on the computer describes what's on screen and the other person/people read a manual based on the descriptions to tell the person at the computer what to do. I played it a lot last semester with my friends. What you can do with multiple people is assign them to different puzzles in the manual. The game's not supposed to be played with more than two people (one at the computer, one at the manual), but I've played it with a few others and it takes a lot of the stress away.",t3_fobqmw

11142,fleury1,t3_fobqmw,"Depends on your personnal tastes and how much time you have to invest. Also depends on what console you have. I have a few recommendations assuming you play on PC.

I am over 30 and among the people I play with, most are between 30 and 40. We all have played competitive and/or hardcore shooters, or survivals most of our lives (CS1.6, CS:S, Operation Flashpoint, Arma series, rust, dayZ, and so on). So it's obvious, we are enjoying **Escape from Tarkov** right now. I know a few other people who are the same age and play a lot, and most of them are involved in games like ""**Eve Online**"" or ""**Dual Universe**"", but here again, they are experimented players, and all those games I mentionned are very complex and hardcore. It's good for a mature player, but it requires to be skilled as well. They all have quite long learning curves as well, so it's probably not the best ""first experience"".

When I think about fun games that are easy to jump in for a noob, I could recommend **Cities Skyline**, where you have to build and manage your city. In **kerbal Space Program**, you have a kind-of-realistic physics, and you build space rockets to explore a whole solar system and study it (very fun !). I also really enjoyed **Subnautica,** a game where you must survive by gathering ressources and building an underwater base on a planet that is covered by sea ... I had stunning moments with this one. Special mention for the thousand of hours I spent on The sims (the first one) when I was a kid. You can build your house and control the people who live in, this is hilarous. Now, **sims 4** has been released, I did not try it, but for somebody who never played this series, it's really worth a try. (I really like games when I have to build/be creative/solve problems so that's something you'll find in all the ones I just mentionned)

Otherwise, a good option is picking up a good AAA solo game depending on your tastes, so you can enjoy casual gameplay, beautiful graphics, good story-telling, and the feeling of power from being the hero of your adventure.

You enjoyed games of throne, lord of the ring, stuff like that ? Try **Skyrim**. It's old, but gold. (also good for noobies, because it's an easy step into the amazing world of ""modding"" =). For about the same audience, ""**The witcher 3**"" is a more recent game, a very good one.

You like gangster stories with cops, murder, drug trafficking with hookers, and corruption ? Go for **Grand Theft Auto 5**.

You like spaghetti western films ? Go for **Red Dead Redemption** (1 and 2)

Like Sci/fi ? Go for the **deus ex** series, or wait for **Cyberpunk 2077**

Post-apocalyptic universe ? Go for Fallout series. I personally only played Fallout : New Vegas, and I really enjoyed it. FOr what I heard, the last one (which is a MMO) is pretty bad. But **Fallout 4** will probably suit a new-comer.

All those are based on my personnal tastes, there are plenty of other good games that I forgot, but you have my 2 cents now :) Really just check on yt some gameplay of what interests you and make your opinion.

Edit : Also, a good first step into video games, is maybe to find a ""roleplay"" game, such as FiveM (for GTA 5). It's not really my thing, but I know there is a niche for this with some older dudes",t3_fobqmw

* For something adventurous with a little fear mixed in: **Subnautica**

* For something wild and arcade-like: **Risk of Rain 2**

* For something addictive and meticulous (challenging): **Factorio** 

* For something mysterious and stealthy, with a good plot: **Aragami**


These are all games that are $30 and under, with really good reviews on Steam, and fun no matter how intense or in depth you want to play. If you end up liking any of these games, you can extract hundreds of hours of fun from them (especially Factorio). All of these games are online, downloadable, and don't take up a lot of storage. None of these games require powerful computers to play. The only actually violent game is Aragami (ninja killing people, but very little gore/gracefully done violence). Risk of Rain 2 has shooting but it is exclusive to arcade-like monsters. 

Stardew Valley, Factorio, and Risk of Rain 2 all have multiplayer functionality.

My proper Journey started with spyro, Crock, Crash bandicoot and Crash team racing. Followed quickly by Red Alert, Tiberian dawn and Age of Empires 1 and 2. Platform/puzzle/adventure games Are easy To learn, and a great place To start. And when you get comfortable, you can spend some time and find your niche corner of the market. I found mine in strategy games, and eventually, when i found Morrowind, RPG games. Oblivion was the holy grail thou, but only because of the Shivering Isles. Fight me. Anyway, i owe all the countless experiences In gaming To those few classics from the PS1 era.

Also, they recently remade the original Spyro trilogy i believe. My girlfriend has been playing them on her PS4.

11264,flfjljk,t1_fleijvu,"So I actually have some trauma concerning Overcooked 2 and new gamers. For a good month or so, it was my job to demo games for the Nintendo Switch at the mall. We had games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Just Dance 2019, Super Mario Party, Pokemon Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu, and Overcooked 2. It was a pretty neat little setup; I'd invite people over to play video games, it didn't cost them anything, and I didn't have to push any sales on anyone, just let the games speak for themselves.

Most of the games were pretty easy to pick up for people who had never touched a video game before (since motion controls are extremely accessible, even if they're fiddly), but Overcooked 2 was the *absolute worst.* I had people who were attracted to Overcooked 2 because the simple, cutesy graphics made it look like a beginner's video game, and they expected to be able to get into it right away because it's gotta be easy, right? And at the beginning I was thinking ""yeah the tutorial level's easy enough for anyone to get into, just chop the lettuce and hand it off to the other players; easy-peasy.""

...except I got a *lot* of people who'd never even *looked* at a video game console before, let alone play one. So I'd sit there, explaining how to move your character with the joy stick and which buttons did what, and I'd explain what the objectives were, in addition to letting them read the on-screen instructions. I held their hand and spoon-fed them information hoping they'd piece the information together alongside hands-on practice, and they'd just.... not. 

They'd sit there looking at the screen expecting their character to move, and I'd say ""you have to tilt your joystick in the direction you want to move"" and they'd look down at their controller and tilt the joystick. Except now they weren't looking at the screen and they lost track of where they were. So they look back up at the screen but now they weren't touching the joystick again, and I'd gently remind them that they have to use the joystick to move. Then they'd look down and forget what a joystick was. So I'd remind them that they have to tilt the thing with their thumb, and hurrah they're able to move again! So they look back up at the screen and forget to change the direction the joystick is tilted in, so their character keeps moving in the same direction and the player would get frustrated that the character isn't going in the direction they want to go.

...then FINALLY by some miracle they manage to get over to where the lettuce is, so I tell them which button they have to press to take the lettuce out of the crate. they look down at their controller, squint hard at the buttons, take a good solid minute to process what I meant by ""right button... no, not the right bumper, the right face button... the one that's right next to your thumb. no, your other thumb, no, *not the screenshot button,* the one with the right-facing arrow on it... *your other right*"" and FINALLY they'd press the thing. Except by this point they'd forget how to move again and we'd have to do *all* that again to get them to the cutting board, and to pass their salads off to the drop-off point. 

By the time they finished *just one* salad, they'd been sitting at the demo booth for 15 minutes. And there's the fact that the timer to the end of the round doesn't actually *start* in the tutorial level until they've completed a salad. So the players would spend all this time and effort to do a single thing, realize the game didn't actually reward them with a fanfare and confetti because *the round wasn't over yet* and they'd be like ""huh. well, okay then."" and just leave. So I'd be sitting there hoping they'd want to take a brochure, but *of course nobody wanted a brochure because it wasn't a fun experience for them.*

I learned very quickly that if someone with zero experience came up to play Overcooked 2, I *had* to direct them to Super Mario Party because the minigames in that game had *motion controls* and *everyone knows how to shake a controller really hard.*

If they get past 10 hours though, they'll make it to 100 before they know it. Then, as you said, they will have played what might be the best game ever made. Once you've played the GOATs, it's really hard to enjoy anything other than masterpieces.

FPS is general are too mechanically involved. I think gamers take for granted how difficult and unnatural K&M or dual stick controls are for non gamers.

I also recommend The Stanley Parable for this reason. It’s first person (basically just walking) but has some elements of other games hidden throughout. On top of that, it will pique your interest in exactly what video games can do with a narrative.

As a great bonus due to the magic in game as well as archer and sneak skills you can build you do not have to be quick to respond to fights, you can avoid them with sneak or use conjuration magic which will get someone/something to fight for you out of thin air or kill the bad guys far away with your bow.

It is rated M because of the potential for blood, I was able to let my son play with a magic character because there was no blood from enemies when you only use magic attacks.  That said there are a few “cut-scene” moments that are unavoidable and do have blood (and a couple beheadings).  Not sure how old your daughter is so wanted to mention that.

I'd go over to play but she would be a brat and not let me play or her mom would take it away from both of us to play Tetris. I wanted my own really bad but just assumed we would never have the money and that I would never get one. That's all I asked for for Christmas that year but told my parents clothes would be OK too or just whatever and I got up on Christmas morning, only had a few packages maybe like 3 and the bigger box was a Nintendo!!! Smaller ones were cheap gifts. I'll never ever forget how happy I was and I made sure that when my friends came over that didn't have one of their own that I let them play as much as they wanted to so that no one would feel like my cousin made me feel.

https://midair.gg/
you can look in the replies for more info, but it looks promising to me

The Tribes series. The only one I played much of was the last title, Tribes: Ascend, but it was fantastic.

It was essentially the go-to ""momentum shooter"" (I think that's what the genre was called?), and I would still be so into shooters if games like Tribes had taken off alongside Hero Shooters like Overwatch, Paladins and the like.

The game's principle mechanic is that your character has a light jetpack and the ability to make frictionless contact with the ground, letting you build up insane speed across the map. Movement and planning your attack actually becomes a major skill, its perfect for showcasing huge maps in hilly terrain, and it basically turns shooters into a completely different experience.",t3_jtg9bf

By the makers of Hitman, it only had one game, but for what it was at the time, it was revolutionary. Missions came in chapters, where you could hit them up in any order but completing objectives on one (and then moving to another) would change up the situation. Take out the heli fuel pad at the police station, and you can now move throw the train yard without having to avoid an attack chopper; take out the supply depot at the train yard, and the enemies at the police station lose their gear and heavier firepower.

To think of how that could be expanded on with today's tech and skills - maybe even in an open world setting - would be phenomenal, especially to have some of Hitman's stealth mechanics included in it.",t3_jtg9bf

The whole campaign was the kind that makes you stay up at night while trying to sleep, thinking about all the details and interactions in that incredibly complex world. 

At this point though, I feel like the chances of getting a worthy sequel are similar to being able to play half-life 3, especially after that joke of warcraft 3 remastered that came out.

12225,gc5xb34,t3_jtg9bf,"X-men Legends. It encapsulated everything I love about the X-me, especially when you compare it to Utlimate Alliance.

In Ultimate Alliance, it feels slightly weird to me that they balanced supers with such differing power levels. In comics and movies, it makes sense that the Avengers could use Hawkeye and Black Widow for stealth projects and areas where brute strength won't cut it. In the game, you're mostly just wading through enemies so Hulk has to hit only slightly harder than Cap, otherwise one of them is OP or one of them is useless.

For the X-men, their power levels are closer, even factoring in mutants like Storm. Iceman, or Colossus. The X-men feel like they all need each other. Wolverine can only work in close range, Cyclops is much better from afar. It makes the game feel more like you're on a SWAT team of super heroes instead of a greatest hits album.

On top of that, the first game gave us excellent missions against anti mutant factions and introduced sentinels in an awesome way. The second greatly expanded the characters you could use and had some great boss fights. A third game about Mr.Sinister could be a great story.

To be clear, there are technically still games in the ""Shining"" series, but they have absolutely *nothing* in common with the original Shining Force series. They don't share the same story or world, they don't share the same art style, hell they aren't even in the same genre.

The original Shining Force series had this really great early 90's fantasy art style to it and the sprite work was amazing. It was a turn based tactics game during battles with explorable towns and story between battles. The game had tons of interesting party members, enemy designs, etc. It even had a pretty great story for a Sega Genesis title.

The original developers, Camelot Software Planning, were originally formed by Sega specifically to make the Shining series. After Shining Force 3 they split from Sega and joined Nintendo. This is where the Shining Series went completely downhill. Shining Force itself died, and none of the games in the Shining series later would resemble Shining Force. The Shining series exists now as generic anime waifu-bait JRPGs.

Under Nintendo Camelot made Golden Sun, another now dead series, which is visually somewhat similar to Shining Force though not the same in gameplay. They continue to make Mario sports titles like the Mario Golf and Tennis series. They are also responsible for the creation of Waluigi.

A lot of people want Golden Sun back, but I remember their original work and would rather have Shining Force back.",t3_jtg9bf

I know it's not a franchise but there are many brick battle games like cross roads, sword fight on the heights I through IV (sfoth for short), chaos canyon, fencing, etc.

Out of all the game I mentioned chaos canyon is the most dead of them and the most played are cross roads,sfoth and fencing (having a max of 100 players at peak hours which is nothing compared to popular games that reached more than 1 million players playing at the same time)

Now, let me talk about what brick battle to inform you about it and what it is.

It's a genre of fighting games in a website called roblox that appeared in 2006 (around the same year as the game itself)

You are given a few tools to help you fight(sword,sling,super ball, rocket launcher, a trowel that can build walls to protect you from all the ranged weapons I mentioned), there are games with more tools than that, but normally you only have the tools I mentioned.

There is also a variation of brick battle games called sword fighting games (in which you are only given a a sword and not the other weapons).

Out of the brickbattle games sfoth and fencing are the only sword fighting games on the list.

That should be enough info, I don't think you guys want to hear about the strategy in these games because there are just so many strategies and I am to lazy to name all of them.

I think this sums this genre of games pretty well, if I made any mistakes feel free to correct me!

Final Fantasy Adventure (the western name for the first game in the series) was among my favorite few Gameboy games, so naturally I was beyond stoked when I realized that Secret of Mana was a coming sequel on SNES. I’ve since played and beaten it likely over 20 times between SNES, later emulators on my PC and PSP, the official VC ROM on Wii, several times on my iPhone (one of the few touch games that works perfectly) and now the collection release on my Switch. 

Legend of Mana on PS1 is my favorite by far. It’s a unique take on how to unfold a world and is so beautifully illustrated with rich sprites on hand painted backgrounds, which was generally unheard of before this game released. It’s a strangely melancholy, humorous and nonsensical set of stories to unfold, but there has never been another game like it.",t3_jtg9bf

The whole ""teleport down as an individual creature"" mechanic was kind of a cool idea, but the game had never done that anywhere else.  
You couldn't drive a tank while in the City phase, or operate an individual creature in the tribal phase.  


TBH, it was always kind of weird to me that the Space phase had you flying around in a UFO in a reversal of the ""expanding scale"" trend of the rest of the game.  
Not complaining, just a bit of an odd choice.  


Also endlessly irritating that I'm flying around in my own ship basically trying to hold together a space-empire on my own, rather than said empire having fleets doing this job and me controlling those. The space phase really needed a strategic layer for that, and the lone piloting thing should have just been an option to do things myself.",t3_jtg9bf

And imo, the design of the hub worlds is very confusing and quite poor. Not to mention the honestly baffling choices with what the game does with certain characters.

There is also HD mod that adds various ""quality of life"" improvements to the game and upgrades the graphics.

Please note, the Horn of Abyss expansion (often abbreviated HotA) works only with the GOG version of the game. It DOES NOT work with the bad version available in other shops (called Heroes 3 HD).

comments say that it's just the main character being submerged underwater but still, it's a weird part of the game.

however, do note that the ""steamy music"" that plays plays in all hot springs, which are your main source of healing, and that the name of the ability ""PK Love"" is determined by the question ""What is your favorite thing?"" which is asked at the beginning of the game.

I remember reading about Dead Space 2 in Game Informer, and how the new producer that was brought in for the sequel said something to the effect of, ""Dead Space was great, but it was almost too scary. We wanted to tone this one down and take a more controlled approach."" Like what the fuck? It's a horror game, it's supposed to be scary.

And you could mix and match. I would use disguises to avoid fights, secretly place explosives, then sneak out to set then off while calling in an arty strike from a nearby mountain. Then since I didn't blow up the commanders tent, I could go in with a helo and bonk him easily for extraction, and fly out.

Sabatuer was the closest game that came to that level of freedom. I feel like AAA games are simply too cookie cutter and designed by algorithm these days to ever have anything as authentically fun as those games. They'll just end up like Just Cause which is like a blunt instrument compared to mercenaries beautiful chaos. Looks similar in verticle slice, but mercs had some SERIOUSLY fun systems layered on top of a simple ""blow things up"" game.

Which is sad. Imagine mercs but with the processing power of the PS5 or w/e. Forget graphics, imagine how far that draw distance could be, the new types of airstrikes and call ins and vehicles we could get, and the size of the map. Get me a game that looks just like mercs 1 but like 9x bigger, a dynamic system for each faction to expand and create content, and I'd be happy for ages. Put in a Shadow of Mordor system, maybe for defectors from various sides as you build a REAL merc company... Oh man.

> Instead of a linear crawl through a single spacecraft, for example, Dead Space 4 would've been an open-world adventure in which Isaac — or whoever ended up starring — would travel between ships, leaving a trail of necromorph corpses in his wake. As players explored the derelict ships, they'd strip some for parts, would use those to fix up others, and would ultimately unravel Dead Space 4's plot by unlocking story data and opening up new exploration routes. The necromorphs' origin story was going to play a big role, and there were going to be all kinds of new undead foes to dismember, too. Zero-gravity zombie fights? Oh yes indeed.
    
> Dead Space 4 would also have excised ""some of the ridiculously expensive one-off action moments,"" delivering a leaner and meaner survival horror experience. Dead Space 3 didn't make enough money to justify another high-budget sequel, and even while working on the sequel, the Visceral team suspected that it'd be the last one. Maybe that's for the best. An open-world space salvage game sounds amazing, but is it really what people expect from Dead Space? Maybe. Maybe not.

Thats why when the box was moved in the clean facility you could see it move in the future through the portal, because the player is travelling through time to pick up the same box from where they left it in the past. That also explains why you can move the future box and the past one wont move, because the box didnt move for that whole time until it was picked up in the future.

This opens some interesting questions about the grandfather paradox. if you set a box in one position in the past, travel to the future and move the box, then travel back to the past and move it from where you originally set it down, what would happen to the box in the future? you wouldn't have been able to move it because the future you moved it in no longed exists because of events you performed in the past after you performed the future.

When buying digital content (movies, games, etc) you aren't actually buying them, rather you are buying the right to download and play that game as it is offered. 

Meaning that, at any time, a store can remove a product or service and despite you having paid for it, they can revoke your ability to download it. For example, you can no longer download games you bought on the Nintendo Wii Shop because that service has shut down. You never bought those games, you just rented them, for a lack of a better term 

It's a shame, I had a lot of games on the Wii Shop channel. Majora's Mask being one of them, now I have to buy that in some other, ideally more permanent form to play it. 

Edit: turns out you can still download Wii shop games but that service is planned to end at an unspecified date:

> In the future we will close all services related to the Wii Shop Channel, including the ability to redownload WiiWare and Virtual Console games, as well as the Wii System Transfer Tool, which transfers data from Wii to the Wii U system.

This is a great feature for safety reasons.  When I went to enable it, I had to agree to a bunch of legalese.

Part of it jumped out at me, basically saying ""you agree to have your camera, microphone, location, etc all turned on automatically, and you will always agree to this from here on out.""  Now, in the context of the feature, that makes sense: if I have my stuff off, it has to be turned on in order to send out all that info.  However, arguably I am then agreeing to let Samsung turn on everything anytime, forever.

People should be using a service hosted on a .gov domain for government-related activities like registering to vote, jury duty, drivers license, etc.

However, dozens of doppelganger websites sprung up. They mostly appeared on .org and .net domains, and what was particularly nefarious was they paid other social media platforms (including Reddit) to promote them. They were advertised using a hard-coded CSS overlay, so your adblocker wouldn't catch it, and you had to actively dismiss the notification to access your social media page. And a ton of these voter registration sites, if you dug around, read the terms of use, and did the same for their affiliate and partner organizations, were rather nefarious with user information.

There was a very popular one, TurboVote, which was actively promoted by Twitter. It looks like a voter registration form, has all the expected questions for it like name, phone number, address, even assures the user that the information is going towards their voter registration form.

After filling all that out, the site then finally asks what state the user is in. Mind you, asking what state the user resides in should be the *first* question on an online voter registration form, as a handful of states do not allow online registration. After selecting the state, you are then redirected to that state's voter registration form, a .gov domain. Mysteriously, all text input fields blank, none of the information provided transferred over. You have to give all that information again.

So what the hell did you just fill out?

If you go to the site's privacy policy, they say they do collect that personal information, but don't sell that data. But they do provide it to their partners so they can render their services.

If you go to their partners' websites, and read their privacy policy, they do retain user information, and they do sell it.

So basically, all these voter registration websites being promoted by Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram celebrities were data mining operations. Their model was to collect, then pass it on to a ""partner"" to sell it so they can honestly state in their privacy policy ""we don't sell your information.""

True. They don't. But their buddy does.

Just use a .gov instead. Yes, those websites are clunky and 20 years old, but they're the official source. You shouldn't be giving personal identifying information to third party intermediaries of unknown ethical standard, no matter how sleek and simple their website is, no matter which major social media platforms they paid to hardcode a CSS overlay promoting them. They should only ask for your state. No name, no address, no date of birth. Just your state, so it can redirect you straight to the state's vote registration page if available.

If you are a United States resident, always contact an attorney in your state before assuming anything in the legal landscape.

First of all, in the United States, you can contract away virtually any right.  There are limits to this, but almost any right otherwise guaranteed by law can be modified or “contracted away” by contract.  It’s pretty much one of the main purposes for a contract.

In the United States, an arbitration clause is often totally valid, and while cases still occur that deal with this issue, the basic rule is that so long as an arbitration clause is conspicuous and the document is clearly intended to be a contract, then it’s fine.  Also, the general rule in US contract law is that anyone who agrees to a contract is assumed to have read it.  “I didn’t read the TOS,” is not in any way a valid defense.

Likewise, the policy on returns and refunds varies from state to state and on the goods in question.  

Anyway, this has been a PSA, and like always, this post has been made for informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice.  For legal advice, please contact a licensed attorney in the state where you reside.

However, buried within the agreement, you will often find there are a few sentences, which explain when they *do* share that information. Typically the first two are legitimate reasons. In order to maintain the integrity of their networks (for ex. hacking the network) and by legitimate court order. The dubious third statement usually expresses their right to share your PII information with third-parties if they ""have a business reason to do so"". Usually this statement is carefully worded, but sometimes it's verbatim. For example, [Reddit's user policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement#text-content11) explicitly states,

> 6 - Things You Cannot Do

These are thing in which *you* as a *user* cannot do, which states

>Use the Services to harvest, collect, gather or assemble information or data regarding the Services or users of the Services **except as permitted in these Terms or in a separate agreement with Reddit**

Now we see Reddit has an agreement with [LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com/) and the LiveRamp service runs in your web browser whenever you access Reddit. LiveRamp is a type of tracker which (according to their website),

>Tie all of your marketing data back to **real people, resolving identity across first-, second-, or third-party digital and offline data silos**.

Furthermore, LiveRamp in turn work with Reddit to maintain their ""privacy compliance"" by stating 

>Don’t lose sleep over privacy compliance. IdentityLink™ operates in a LiveRamp Safe Haven® environment.

Basically, even Reddit's ""privacy"" policy is in place to insure you agree to all of this and cannot in any way hold them responsible for the dissemination of your PII information with companies who tie your Reddit account to information collected from sources inside and outside the internet.",t3_avq7hy

This practice was challenged at the Supreme Court a few years ago, and the conservative majority gave it their blessing, so nearly every company you now deal with has followed suit.  


2)  Terms updating.  Most contracts now contain a clause that says they can update the contract unilaterally without consent from you.  So whatever you agree to, they can just change, and there's nothing you can do about it.  You are still legally held to the contract, but they are not.

 Arbitration is an ineffective and inefficient method of encouraging or enforcing fair and ethical business behavior.


Lawsuits allow employees and consumers to sanction a business, to hold a legal threat over its head if it acts in a way legally liable in a civil context. It's the stick that comes behind the carrot in encouraging ethical business. Without a class-action suit, each individual employee or customer must take their own time, money, and risk to address these behaviors--which means fewer individuals will achieve representation, and so the risk of harm to a business for acting in an unethical manner harmful to its employees or customers is fractional.

First off, outraged, semi-organized people make companies change their terms and conditions all the time. Second, there are norms of business that a court recognizes over these terms and conditions.

He phoned up the people who wrote the terms, who subsequently changed it almost immediately, proving not a single person had ever read to even page 17 out of 35.

&#x200B;

Oh, and if you screw up and someone in Pakistan sues Epic cause you failed to properly license your mod under their laws, you agree to pay all of Epic's legal bills.

&#x200B;

You also agree that it's ok for Epic to install anything it wants on your computer, for any reason, without notifying you.(Technically, Epic has to call it a patch, update, or upgrade, but it's a distinction without a difference.) Furthermore, you agree not to try to figure out what they have installed on your machine or what it is doing.

&#x200B;

Also, if Epic wants to adjust the agreement, they don't have to tell you or get your consent; all they have to do is post it on their website and you agree to monitor the website and stop using the software if you don't like a new term. (I suspect that they notify via in-game notice in practice, though.)

Epic is, of course, allowed to terminate your license to use anything you've purchased, for any reason, at any time, without telling you. (They simply decide you've violated their behaviour clause, in their sole discretion.) It's up to you to stop using it immediately, whether they tell you or not, though.

So hitting the clock is totally normal, and actually required, to use it.

To people who primarily use PCs and android losing backwards compatibility is a hard thing to understand, because google and microsoft have put a lot of work into making sure that old software works despite their new frameworks.

&#x200B;

Apple does no such thing, so if you want persistence in the app store you are constantly updating and maintaining your application.

&#x200B;

As a developer myself I'll write an android app and sell it to you and you will get to use it forever and ever and I have no problem with it. If it comes off the app store I'll release the APK so you can side load it even. IOS, you got it for the version of IOS I sold it for, once it's off the app store at usually apple's discretion, good luck.

&#x200B;

This problem is why so much software is sold in a software as a service package now, where you pay a monthly subscription fee.  And also why games are usually free to play but pay 2 win and loaded with microtransactions.

I work for a company that sells and manages arrays for major online corporations. You name some of the biggest companies you can think of online and we probably manage it.

We can take a class that goes into the details of how modern technology went from using cookies (which are still used, but is an outdated method), which gathered information based on what and where you clicked on their site and over weeks, built a profile on you to taking it to instantly building a profile on you on the first click, comparing it to other visitors that looked at or bought something on their site (and other sites) and sells that information to other companies to build ads that are directed at you.

It’s the reason if you go to amazon and look at a bunch of stuff then go over to Facebook and start seeing ads for those exact products on amazon or even other sites.
They even start directing ads of things you haven’t looked at before, but fall into common interest of things you have and that others have similar interest in as you and they bought the thing already.
It’s like they know what you are going to buy before you know it.

It’s bitter sweet depending on how you look at it, but I always get a laugh when people find out that their info is getting sold and they now have to leave Facebook to go off the grid, but don’t realize that they would pretty much have to go completely offline if they dont want their browsing and buying habits sold to pretty much everyone.

It is against export control regulations to sell a sensor that doesn't abide by these limits, but you *could* theoretically build one that bypasses these regulations yourself. Since the US does not artificially degrade precision as it used to (selective availability), you could theoretically build a GPS receiver yourself that you can use past the COCOM limits if you were so inclined.
